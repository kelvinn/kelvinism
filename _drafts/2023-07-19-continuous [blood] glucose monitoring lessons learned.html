<p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>- Huge bowl or pasta and my blood glucose skyrocked, high enough that I double checked with a finger prick</p><p>- Sports drinks with even a relatively low amount of carbs create a big reaction</p><p>- My PB and Honey sandwich on wholemeal grainy bread doesn't create that large of a reaction</p><p>- Non-alcoholic beer creates a pretty reaction. I guess I forgot they still had carbs?</p><p>- I'm seeing large spike after my shower - usually around 9pm. I might try to shower earlier. This might also be from the maltodextrin I discovered that's in Metamucil, but isn't listed on my container.</p><p>- Eating carbs with protein and fibre really seem to flatten the curve</p><p>-&nbsp;</p>
