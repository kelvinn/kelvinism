<p>Another line needing to be ported over: fax.  Since time is very constrained, I quickly setup an extra server (OS X, actually) to act as a fax server.  The fax line inserts immediately into the server, then from there any new faxes are printed on a normal printer and dropped into a central shared repository for the CSRs to access. Surely we will replace this setup sometime in the future, but for now it gets the job done.</p><br />
