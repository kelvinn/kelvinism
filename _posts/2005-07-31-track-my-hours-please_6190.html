<p>Initially all CSRs were hired as temps, which means they had their own timesheets.  Some new people have been hired as full/part-time employees, so we need to handle their timesheets -- plus, several people (including myself) are paid on an hourly basis.  Perfect time to setup a Timesheet.</p><p>Since we are still small, with no ERP, and I don't have time or desire to write a timesheet app, I decided to do some research.  I found a few on SourceForge, but I wanted something uber-simple to use and uber-simple to install.  I settled upon <a href="http://www.timesheetphp.com/">TimesheetPHP</a>.  Luckily it even allowed LDAP support, which would be useful eventually for SSO.  Installation was a breeze, and now everybody logs hours onto the an intraweb server.</p><p>A simple, simple solution to a simple, simple problem.</p><br />
