<br /><br/> <p>Currently our ERP setup is a nightmare, both in stability, features and especially administration.  A new solution is in order.  After collecting goals/requirements we have begun researching, and even started testing some platforms.  The "other half" of the IT department and I installed and tested <a href="http://www.compiere.com">Compiere</a> today on a spare (albeit low performance) rackmount.  For those of you (most) who don't know, Compiere is an ERP solution that ties together all the faucets of a company under one hood.  We are impressed with Compiere, but installation is a bit on the complicated side. </p> <p>In the end, we opted for Compiere to be managed and hosted externally, yet we would still administer many aspects (regarding user interaction).</p>
