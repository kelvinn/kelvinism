<p>My friend <a href="http://www.ianfitzpatrick.com">Ian</a> told me about this originally, but my pen-testing cousin just send me the link as well. p2p VPN, w00t. Hamachi is a VPN alternative that does not have the normal router problems associated with IPSEC and PPTP vpns. That is good because of firewalls and nat and things like that.</p> <p> http://www.hamachi.cc/</p><br />
