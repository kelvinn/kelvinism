<p>The webapp server is running fine, but backups are important.  Better yet, a hot computer is a great idea.  To do this, I setup an older spare rackmount as a 'live' webapp server, just in case.  A duplicate LAMP was setup, web apps copied over SSH via rsync on a regular basis, and the icing on the cake: mysql replication.</p><p>So, if the dedicated webapp server dies a painful death, a quick change of IP for the webapp server in the internal DNS to the backup rackmount, and nobody will know anything happened.</p><br />
