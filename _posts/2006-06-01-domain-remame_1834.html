<p>Before we grow any further, a new DNS scheme is in order.  Following the pattern of: citycode.domain.com - shouldn't be too hard.  A slightly stressful rename of the PDC (just one so far, still small) was in order.  After that (and client computers re-associated), the routers were updated, the DNS server updated, and everything worked peachie.  Not bad for a weekends worth of work.</p><br />
