<p>Backing up across the states has worked decently well, but due to several changes a more dedicated backup solution is in order.  Desiring something quick, simple and inexpensive, research revealed a company that would perfectly fit the requirements.  <a href="http://www.ibackup.com">iBackup</a> was a perfect substitute - instead of SSH+rsync to another office, iBackup provides rsync over ssl to their data center.  A few simple changes to the cron job, and backup location is thus changed.</p><br />
