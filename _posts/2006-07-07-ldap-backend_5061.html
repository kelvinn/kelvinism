<p>Users don't like to remember passwords, heck, I don't like to remember to use passwords.  I decided to upgrade all the webapps to authenticate off the domain, welcome a start to SSO.  To do this I implemented the <a href="http://adldap.sourceforge.net/">adldap php class</a> to control authentication to each webapp.  Thus, a simple GPO can control who has access to the app or not.  A simple solution to a rather simple problem.</p><br />
