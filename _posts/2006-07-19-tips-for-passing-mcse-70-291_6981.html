<p>As you may know, I&#39;ve been taking a few of the MCSE:Security tests when I have time.&nbsp; This afternoon I passed the 70-291, which is claimed to be the hardest of all the tests (and of the one&#39;s I&#39;ve taken so far, I would concur).</p><p>&nbsp;I&#39;m taking my tests at the <a href="http://www.geego.com/">Geego Systems</a>  center.&nbsp; If you are in Taipei for some reason, and needing a place to take some tests, this place is a safe bet.&nbsp; Their staff is pretty darn cool, and they let me drink as much tea as I want.</p><p>&nbsp;Anyways, the test.&nbsp; I can&#39;t talk about any of the questions, &#39;cause I&#39;ve &quot;signed&quot; an NDA, and Microsoft will take away my certification(s).&nbsp; But, I&#39;ll tell you what I did to study.</p><p>I took three approaches, as I do to all the tests.</p><p>1) Get an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMCSA-MCSE-70-291-Exam-Cram%2Fdp%2F0789736187&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Exam Cram2 70-291</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> book, and read it through, cover-to-cover.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is a great way to get to know the language used, and some of the concepts.&nbsp; Exam Cram 2 books do a pretty good job of cutting out the fluff.</p><p>2) I have a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMastering-Windows-Server-2003-Minasi%2Fdp%2F0782141307&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Mastering Windows Server 2003</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> that I picked up in Hong Kong last year.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t do a good job of cutting out the fluff, which makes it a great resource to flip through.&nbsp; It is seems to have almost every tutorial you could imagine.&nbsp; The one downside though, as there always is one, is that the book is starting to get a little dated.&nbsp; Either way, this has to be one of the most complete books on 2003 I have ever flipped through.</p><p>3) It is all fine and dandy to read, but it is my belief that everything you read, you should do.&nbsp; My little lab (see end of post for my cool diagram) seems to suite me quite well.&nbsp; If you have read this far, and want some things to do in your test lab, this is what I would recommend:</p><ul><li>DNS - Know how to add CNAME&#39;s, A records and play with MX records.&nbsp; Know how to prioritize mail servers.&nbsp; Know how to create aliases.</li><li>WSUS - Sadly, many of the books I&#39;ve seen (or the two listed above), don&#39;t talk about WSUS.&nbsp; I believe Microsoft just made the change on their tests, but it is on there.&nbsp; And they hit this topic pretty hard, so be prepared.</li><li>Security Templates&nbsp; - Creating baselines and doing audits</li><li>Network Security - Configuring firewalls, configure VPN between two networks (RRAS) </li><li>DHCP - Creating scopes, relay agents and reserving client addresses</li><li>TCP/IP -This test has a pretty big backbone of TCP/IP.&nbsp; Know how to subnet, and general networking terms/methods.&nbsp; Picking up a book on the Network+ certification, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNetwork%252B-Exam-Cram-N10-003-2nd%2Fdp%2F0789732548&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Exam Cram2 Network+</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> book (which I read to refresh myself, and pass the Network+ test), could be useful.</li></ul><p>Luckily I was able to get a few years of some real life hands-on experience with installing, implementing and managing AD through a previous I.T. position.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice always helps though.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>&nbsp; <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oEH0-D6u_5NS1GNKIWOgzw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRAYID3YQBXBCuCbW2zToLhdeeNfdGsPblTtncJsJYOUWYiL2kWNmCjjN7-XbNxr6IGWk-JJkDeY39TNWjpH3Begkbr0bhO-TWoxz37Lojgwj9nre_4I8hsh9y020Efb5myfI7hL_apz4E/s800/70291.jpg" height="777" width="452" /></a><br />
