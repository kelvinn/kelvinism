<p>After consulting several vendors in Kuala Lumpur, I was able to get the right Cisco with the right IOS.  One of their technicians came and installed it, and that night I hooked it up to our VPN.  Besides the fact that the internet distribution is still a little shady in Kuala Lumpur, the connection remains somewhat stable, and yet another node is brought on the company intranet.</p><br />
