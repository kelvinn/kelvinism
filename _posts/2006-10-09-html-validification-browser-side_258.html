<p>I like most standards, I can't deny it.  One thing that I find too humorous is the amount of sites that are not valid, even sites that claim they are.  One tool in my box is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/249/">HTML Validator</a>, an extensioin for Firefox.  A nice little icon appears in the lower right, indicating whether a page is valid, not-so-valid, or really-not-so-valid.  Makes it easy to check your own sites, and others.</p><br />
