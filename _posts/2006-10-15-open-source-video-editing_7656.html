<p>In the next year I plan to make a little video, nothing fancy likely, but something that will require an editor.  However, I don't own a mac (which rules our Final Cut Pro + After Effect and iMovie, which Ian and I both have had too much fun with.  Inside joke.) I'm also a die-hard Linux fan, trying to hold out buying a mac for as long as possible.</p> <p>  SF to the rescure.  There are four editors listed, and in the next year I'll try them all.  Overalll, they look quite promising.</p>   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jahshakafx">Jahshaka</a> -- Beta. Good reviews from what I've seen.<br /> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kdenlive">Kdenlive</a> -- Alpha/Beta. Looks a lot less mature than Jahshaka, especially since I'm going to have to check it out via svn.  But, the screenshots look quite impressive.<br /> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lives">LiVES</a> -- Beta.<br /><br />
