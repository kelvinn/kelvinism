<p>Yea, you read that right.  Three commands and you can run a pen-test on your website/webserver.  So, how?</p> <div class="code"> kelvin@home:~$ sudo apt-get install nikto<br /> kelvin@home:~$ sudo nikto -update<br /> kelvin@home:~$ nikto -h www.thoughtdeposit.net</div> <p>As you can see, Nikto is a web server scanner, apparently for over 3200 dangerous files/vulnerabilities.  Additional features can be seen at the <a href="http://www.cirt.net/code/nikto.shtml">Nikto</a> website, yet you will certainly want to add this old gem to your webserver toolbelt as soon as possible.</p><br />
