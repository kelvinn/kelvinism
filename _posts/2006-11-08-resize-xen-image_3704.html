<p>So, you've got a few Xen images around, and they are starting to fill up.  How do you add a few more gigs to 'em?</p> <pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "> root@tpe:/# xm shutdown vm01<br /> root@tpe:/# cd /xenimages<br /> root@tpe:/xenimages# dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1000000 >> vm01.img<br /> root@tpe:/path/to/images# resize2fs -f vm01.img<br /> </pre>  That's it, you just added a gig to your image called 'vm01.img'.<br />
