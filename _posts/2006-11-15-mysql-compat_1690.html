I've run into this error quite a few times, might as well toss blog entry about it:<br />
<span class="code"> ERROR 1064 at line 17: You have an error in your SQL syntax near 'ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1' at line 7</span>  <br />
One likely reason this comes about is because the data being imported/exported is not compatible with the database version.  For instance, at home you export the information from a mysql5 database.  Then you try to import it on a mysql3.23 database somewhere else -- and it craps out on you. Bummer.<br />
The solution is quite simple:<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">
 mysqldump --compatible=mysql323 -u root -p database &gt; exportName.sql</pre>
<br />
