<p>Historically I&#39;ve used the ever-so-popular AutoMySQLBackup script.&nbsp; While it seems to work just fine, I&#39;ve decided to give another solution a whirl.&nbsp; This solution, provided through <a href="http://www.zmanda.com/">Zmanda</a>, seems to be less hackery and more enterprise.&nbsp; The instructions are very clear, and the backup test went as planned.&nbsp; Looks&nbsp; like this is another gem for the toolchest.</p><br />
