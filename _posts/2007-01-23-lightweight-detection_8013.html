I love my Snort, I really do.&nbsp; But sometimes, I just don't need all the extra overhead -- sometimes the resources on a server are somewhat, limited.&nbsp; Looking for a solution I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/">PSAD</a> , a way to detect port scans.&nbsp; Since port scans are often one of the first tactics used to find vulnerabilities on a server, it is a pretty good idea to detect them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the attack, I receive a nice little email telling me what is going on.&nbsp; To test it out I first fired up nmap, and received a few emails.&nbsp; Next I fired up nessus with updated plugins -- you can be the judge.&nbsp; I now have 50 emails from myself telling me somebody is doing something naughty:<br />
