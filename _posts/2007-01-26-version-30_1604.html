<p>To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):</p><p>I think I&#39;m going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.&nbsp; Time to stop being lazy.&nbsp; Time to stop procrastinating.&nbsp; Time to learn something new.</p><p>Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won&#39;t be based off PHP. </p>
