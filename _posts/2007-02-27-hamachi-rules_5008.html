<p>I've been playing around more with <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/">Hamachi</a>, and have decided that it officially rules.  Since I'm a big Linux guy I don't have access to some features, but the program seems to be a gem.  It is brainlessly easy to install (even when doing 20 things at once), and works quite well.  Thanks to Ben and Sean for helping me test it out.</p>
