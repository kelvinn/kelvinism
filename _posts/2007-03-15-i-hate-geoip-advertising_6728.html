GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.</div><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_IP_database">GeoIP</a> is the concept that allows you to map a user's IP to the country it came from (I hacked up my commenting system just so you can see an example, if you are a visual type of person).  Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads "better," hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele.  Sometimes the adaptation doesn't quite work as expected.  This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) -- and just had to snap a few screenshots.  The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and "customized" the advertisement.  Needless to say, I've seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.</p><p>This reminded me just how much crap people know about me; since I'm in a coffeeshop, I don't <i>really</i> care, but still.  So, why do I hate GeoIP advertising?</p><ul><br /><li>It reminds me how much crap people know about me</li><br /><li>It reminds me that I should be using the Tor network</li><br /><li>Instead of displaying contextual ads that I even <i>might be a little</i> inclined to click, it reminds me how much I hate advertising</li><br /><li>Remember, I'm in a coffee shop?

Enter <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>, <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> and <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">FoxyProxy</a>.  I turned them all on, went back and remembered just how cool these tools really are. </p><br />
