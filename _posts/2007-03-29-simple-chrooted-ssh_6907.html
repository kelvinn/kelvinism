You might be asking: why would you want to chroot ssh? Why use ssh anyways?  Here are the quick answers:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><b>FTP usually sucks</b>.  Unless sent over SSL, all information is sent <i>cleartext</i>.</li>
<br />
<li><b>SSH usually rules</b>. SSH sends all data over an encrypted channel -- the main drawback is: you can often browse around the system, and if permissions aren't set right, read things you shouldn't be able to.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Chroot'd SSH rocks</b>. The solution to both the above problems</li>
</ul>
.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, let me tell a quick story.<br />
When I started uni in 2001 I was a nerd. Still a nerd, I guess.  I was cramped in my apartment on campus with like 5 boxes, most of them crappy p100s running Linux or OpenBSD.  Life was good.<br />
I started a CS degree (shifted into Business with a focus on IT), and we were told to use the school's main servers to compile our programs.  The other interesting thing is that <i>all</i> user accounts were visible when logged in via ssh -- but hey, that is just the nature of Linux.  I knew this, but asked the head I.T. person "why don't you jail the connections?"  He responded quickly telling me to go away.<br />
Well, shortly after making the comment (although solutions existed at the time being), pam-chroot was released.  This is right about the time students figured they could spam everybody in the school, some 25,000 emails, quickly and easily -- 'cause all the accounts were displayed.  Sweet -- now we can chroot individual ssh connections.<br />
This quick demo will be on Debian, we'll create a pretend user named "karl." (I'll assume you've already added the user before beginning these steps).  Also, the jails will be in /var/chroot/{username}<br />
<h4>
First: Install libpam-chroot and makejail</h4>
session required pam_chroot.so<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
kelvin@server ~$ sudo apt-get install libpam-chroot makejail</pre>
<br />
<br />
<h4>
Second: makejail config file</h4>
<br />
<br />
Put the following in /etc/makejail/create-user.py:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
#Clean the jail

cleanJailFirst=1


preserve=["/html", "/home"]


chroot="/var/chroot/karl"


users=["root","karl"]

groups=["root","karl"]


packages=["coreutils"]
</pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Edit</b>: If you need to use SFTP also, try this config:<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
cleanJailFirst=1

preserve=["/html", "/home"]

chroot="/home/vhosts/karl"

forceCopy=["/usr/bin/scp", "/usr/lib/sftp-server", /

 "/usr/bin/find", "/dev/null", "/dev/zero"]

users=["root","karl"]

groups=["root","karl"]

packages=["coreutils"]
</pre>
<br />
<br />
As you'll see, there is a "preserve" directive.  This is so that when you "clean" the jail (if you need to refresh the files, for instance), you won't wipe out anything important.  I created an /html so that the user can upload their web docs to that file.<br />
<h4>
Third: configure libpam_chroot</h4>
<br />
Add the following to /etc/pam.d/ssh:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
# Set up chrootd ssh

session required pam_chroot.so
</pre>
<br />
<br />
<h4>
Forth: allow the actual user to be chrootd</h4>
<br />
Edit /etc/security/chroot.conf and add the following:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
karl /var/chroot/karl</pre>
<br />
<br />
<h4>
Fifth: create/chown the chroot'd dir</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
kelvin@server ~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/chroot/karl/home

kelvin@server ~$ sudo chown /var/chroot/karl/home
</pre>
<br />
<br />
Now you should be able to log in, via the new username karl.
