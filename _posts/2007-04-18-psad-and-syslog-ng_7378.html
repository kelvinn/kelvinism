I really like using PSAD, both on my server and my laptop.  You never know where the mean people are.  I also seem to use syslog-ng quite often, meanwhile PSAD seems oriented to syslog.  This is fine, and I'm pretty sure the install.pl for the source built will configure syslog-ng.conf automatically.  However, I almost always tend to stick with packages if I can -- if they are even remotely close to the current version.<br />
Anyways, if you need to get syslog-ng.conf configured for PSAD, this is what you need to do:<br />
Add this code to the "# pipes" section, maybe stick to keeping it alphabetical.<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
destination psadpipe { pipe("/var/lib/psad/psadfifo"); };</pre>
<br />
<br />
Next, go down a little to the "# filters" section, add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
filter f_kerninfo { facility(kern); };</pre>
<br />
<br />
And finally in the last section, add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
log {
        source(s_all);
        filter(f_kerninfo);
        destination(psadpipe);
};</pre>
<br />
<br />
Restart syslog-ng, and you are good to go. Cheers to Michael Rash at <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/">Cipherdyne</a> for his work on PSAD.
