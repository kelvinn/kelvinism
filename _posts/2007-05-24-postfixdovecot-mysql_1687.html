As you can see by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/tech-blog/gentoo-test/">another post</a>, I decided to reinstall the server.  This isn't really a problem, I have pretty good backups.  I've installed apache and friends a bagillion times.  However, Postfix(chroot)+Dovecot authenticating from MySQl, that doesn't install quite so smoothly.<br />
Just for my future reference, and maybe helpful for somebody, someday.  Clearly not a tutorial. The postfix chroot = /var/spool/postfix<br />
<h4>
cannot connect to saslauthd server: No such file or directory</h4>
<br />
<br />
First, get the saslauthd files into the postfix chroot. Edit /etc/conf.d/saslauthd (or /etc/default/saslauthd), and add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
SASLAUTHD_OPTS="-m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"</pre>
<br />
<br />
Second, add it to the init script.<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
stop() {
        ebegin "Stopping saslauthd"
        start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet /
--pidfile /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd/saslauthd.pid
        eend $?
}</pre>
<br />
<br />
Third, maybe, change /etc/sasl2/smtpd.conf (or /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf) and add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux</pre>
<br />
<br />
Ok, that error should go away now.<br />
<h4>
Recipient address rejected: Domain not found;</h4>
<br />
<h4>
(Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=<i>domain.com</i></h4>
<br />
<br />
These are actually the same type of error.  Copy /etc/resolv.conf into the chroot.<br />
<h4>
fatal: unknown service: smtp/tcp</h4>
<br />
<br />
Copy /etc/services into the chroot.<br />
I searched google for these answers, to a certain degree at least, but couldn't really find much.  Then I remembered "crap, this is a chroot, it needs things" -- and fixed stuff.  If you came here from google, and these super quick notes were helpful, feel free to leave a comment, or contact me directly if you have any questions.<br />
