I've received this error more than once, so I'm finally writing my notes how I solve it.<br />
<h4>
Error message:</h4>
<br />
W: GPG error: http://security.debian.org stable/updates Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A70DAF536070D3A1<br />
<br />
This really is just your standard don't-have-the-gpg-keys error.  So, get'em -- take the last eight digits from the long NO_PUBKEY string <b>that is displayed on your computer</b>.  If you are using Debian 4.0, the above key is likely correct; if you are using Ubuntu or another version of Debian, it will be wrong.  (The last eight digits are used as an identifier at the keyservers). Then:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 6070D3A1
gpg --export 6070D3A1 | apt-key add -</pre>
<br />
<br />
Repeat if necessary. All done, just do an apt-get update and no more warning!<br />
