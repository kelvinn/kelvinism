Since I've already covered a really simple syndication example, I'll move onto something a little more complex.  Let's say you want to offer syndication that is slightly more custom.  The Django <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/syndication_feeds/">syndication docs</a> give an example from <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/">Adrian's</a> <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">Chicagocrime.org</a> syndication of beats.  I had to ponder a minute to get "custom" syndication to work, so here's my example from start to finish.<br />
First, as usual, feeds.py<br />
<h4>
feeds.py</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true">
class PerDirt(Feed):

    link = "/"
    copyright = 'Copyright (c) 2007, Blog Mozaic'
    
    def get_object(self, bits):
        from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
        if len(bits) != 1:
            raise ObjectDoesNotExist
        my_dirt = get_object_or_404(Dirt, slug__exact=bits[0])
        return my_dirt

    def title(self, obj):
        return obj.slug
    
    def description(self, obj):
        return obj.description
    
    def items(self, obj):
        from django.contrib.comments.models import FreeComment
        return FreeComment.objects.filter(object_id=obj.id).order_by('-submit_date')
</pre>
<br />
You can see that this differs slightly from the simpler syndication example.  I'll not a few things.  But first, I need to show urls.py:<br />
<h4>
urls.py</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true">
feeds = {
    'mydirt': PerDirt,
}

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^feeds/(?P&lt;url&gt;.*)/$', 'django.contrib.syndication.views.feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),
)</pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's pretend the dirt word (or if you were doing a blog, you could do this based on slug) is "nifty". So, the process is like this: a request comes in as /feeds/mydirt/nifty/ -- it is first looked up in the feed_dict (because of the mydirt part) and then sent to PerDict.  Once in PerDict it hits the first def, get_object.  One of the things that confused me at first is what the 'bits' part is.  Simply put: it is the crap after you tell Django which feed to use.  Similar to the beats example, I'm testing to make sure the length is only one -- so if the word doesn't exist or somebody just types in feeds/mydirt/nifty/yeehaaa/ -- they will get an error.  Next the object is looked up, in this case the dirt word (in your case, maybe a blog entry).<br />
The title and description are self-explanatory.  The items are a query from the FreeComment database, ordered by date.  What we need next is the correct templates.<br />
<h4>
templates/feeds/mydirt_title.html</h4>
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: html; light: true ">
Comment by {{ "{{" }} obj.person_name }}</pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, the filename is important (mydirt_title). obj.person_name is the name from the comment.<br />
<h4>
templates/feeds/mydirt_description.html</h4>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: html; light: true ">
{{ "{{" }} obj.comment }}
Posted by: {{ "{{" }} obj.person_name }}
Published: {{ "{{" }} obj.submit_date }}</pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are curious how to get that little orange icon next to your site's url, you do this:<br />
<pre class="brush: html; light: true ">
<link href="/feeds/mydirt/{{ "{{" }} dirt_object.dirtword }}/" rel="alternate" title="Your Dirt" type="application/rss+xml"></link></pre>
<br />
<br />
That's it.  Hopefully I've explained how to create somewhat custom syndication feeds, in case you needed another example.
