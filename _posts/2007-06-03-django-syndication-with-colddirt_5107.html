Creating feeds in Django is freaking simple.  I'll start with an example of just updating a feed with the newest objects (for instace, newest blog posts).  Similar to the forms.py way of handling our different forms, I've created a feeds.py to handle the feeds.<br />
<h4>
feeds.py</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">

from django.contrib.syndication.feeds import Feed
from colddirt.dirty.models import Dirt

class LatestDirts(Feed):
    title = "Cold Dirt"
    link = "/"
    description = "When you have dirt, you've got dirt.  Right..."
    copyright = 'All Rights Unreserved'
    
    def items(self):
        return Dirt.objects.all()[:50]

</pre>
<br />
<br />
What this will do is query our Dirt DB and return an obj.  The fields here are pretty well documented in the Django docs, besides being pretty obvious.<br />
<h4>
urls.py</h4>
<br />
We need three things in our urls.py -- first, import our feeds from feeds.py:<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
from colddirt.feeds import LatestDirts</pre>
<br />
<br />
Next, we map the feed we want to a name urls.py can use:<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
feeds = {
    'newdirt': LatestDirts,
}
</pre>
<br />
<br />
Finally we create which URL to use for the feeds:<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
    (r'^feeds/(?P<url>.*)/$', 'django.contrib.syndication.views.feed', {'feed_dict': feeds}),</url></pre>
<br />
<br />
When we look at a request, the process goes like this: it comes in as /feeds/newdirt/, which then gets looked up and matches newdirt in the feeds_dict.  Next, LatestDirts is looked at and evaluated, and returned.  But how is it returned?  One final thing to do is create a template for the feed to use, which is where we can tell exactly <i>what</i> is to be displayed to the user.<br />
<h4>
templates/feeds/newdirt_title.html</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; ">{{ "{{" }} obj.dirtword }}</pre>
<br />
<h4>
templates/feeds/newdirt_description.html</h4>
<br />
<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; ">{{ "{{" }} obj.description }}</pre>
<br />
The naming for the templates, as usual, is important.  If you want to have that little orange RSS button near your url, add this to your template's head:<br />
<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; ">
<link href="/feeds/newdirt/" rel="alternate" title="That's dirty..." type="application/rss+xml"></link></pre>
<br />
<br />
So, there you have it, a simple example of how to use Django's syndication framework.  I'll follow this up with another slightly more complex tutorial.<br />
