<p>I generally like Firefox, and generally like Google.  But having Google suggest enabled when I search for things is annoying, at least on my rather small laptop screen.  Mostly it is because my internet right now is pretty crap, so I try to cut down on any extra traffic.  Anyhow, I didn't even both Googling how to do this:</p><p>Type in 'about:config' into your address bar and type 'search' in the top filter bar.  Look about half-way down for this:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">browser.search.suggest.enabled
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Double click it to turn it to false.  All done.</p>
