<p>Today on <a href="http://community.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/06/07/1458229">Linux.com, Liferea was mentioned</a>  I find this particularly because I've been using Liferea for quite a few months, and haven't been able to find anything that better suits my needs.  It sits quietly in the corner until a new RSS is available, and slightly changes color.  Plus, it integrates wonderfully into GNOME.</p><p>Well, the Linux.com article does a great job summarizing the reader, so if you are in the market, I'd take a look.  For posterities sake, I took a screenshot of the Linux.com feed of Liferea, in Liferea.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GiTUvj2FlLe0cVvbZV3Deg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvsniPdfJxZMp6paqoK1axzlYJ7o-YKnrQkJvY466s5PsPQ2AU0g5o2P8EOgHH2o6iLBTGbAEOx69aRRDX34_ShNen-YjAYkI42bWeoGPktPnw73uP13s3j3keWgFrvB9PZPN4tUiWHpFp/s400/screenshot-liferea.jpg" /></a>
