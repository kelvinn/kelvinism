<p>You can easily see that I am a big Linux fan, I've mentioned this over and over.  I've also mentioned that I'm finishing up my MCSE, which started as a dare with my buddy, Ian.  In the process of studying for my MCSE I've developed a certain amount of respect for Windows Server 2003, yet I'll comment more on this later.</p><p>What I really wanted to write two paragraphs about was an interesting discovery I made today.  I happened to stumble over to Microsoft's hardware site, and noticed in my little Server Spy monitor that it was running IIS/7 -- the first time I have seen this anywhere.  Upon further investigation I perused their <a href="http://www.iis.net/default.aspx?tabid=7&subtabid=79">GoLive program</a>, which details several ways to test drive IIS7.  There are some details about Microsoft's setup, which one would expect to be impressive.  And it is.  So, if you are a Microsoft person, you may want to grab a test drive of Beta3 while you still can.</p>
