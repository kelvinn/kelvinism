<p>I'm in Tibet right now, so will keep this somewhat brief.</p><p>For the next few hours I'll be sitting in this dingy internet cafe in Lhasa updating my blog with my travels.  I happened to look down and on the monitor it says "works with windows vista".  I find this quite humorous, <i>of course</i> it is going to work with vista, it is a normal generic monitor.</p><p>Anyhow, I guess there is a reason for marketing.  Back to writing our travels.</p>
