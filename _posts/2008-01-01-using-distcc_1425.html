<p>I'm in the process of working on one of my projects, and the requirement came up to download a fairly large file (4GB).  Since I only receive ~20GB/month at my house, I decided to just use my server in the U.S. The next requirement came about needing to compile Mapnik, which I had intended to do on the server at some point anyways, yet I ran into memory constraints.</p><p>Good old distcc comes to the rescue.  I don't need to use distcc that often, yet when I do, it is very handy.  However, I always forget to set g++ to use distcc as well.  So, for when I forget next time...</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">DISTCC_HOSTS='home'
./configure
make CC=distcc CXX=distcc</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Maybe one of these days I'll write a more in depth tutorial for installing distcc, yet until then, you can <a href="http://wiki.vpslink.com/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Install/Configure_Distcc">peruse the notes</a> I left on my VPS provider's wiki.</p>
