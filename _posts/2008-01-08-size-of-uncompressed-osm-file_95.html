<p>I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OSM</a> a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map.  At first I wanted to do it on my VPS -- but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn't a way.  Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database.  Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn't have (although I'm writing some code that might make this possible in the future).</p><p>The second problem exists with CPU usage.  Processes on my VPS don't really utilize the CPU much, which means renicing the process doesn't do a thing.  The CPU pegs at 100%, as it is supposed to do, except that the VPS auto-kills processes that stay at 100% for any length of time.  Luckily somebody wrote a program called "cpulimit" (apt-get install cpulimit) that will cap the CPU usage for a process.</p><p>The last problem that I thought about is <i>what if</i> I could uncompress the file.  Would that use less memory to stick it in the database?  I searched and searched but couldn't find an answer to how big the actual .osm file is.  I ultimately broke down and decided to spend the 50c it would take to get this all done with EC2, and write some scripts to automate it in the future.</p><p>However, since I've finally uncompressed the .osm, I can tell you that as of about January 1st, 2008, the uncompressed OSM size is 67GB.  </p>
