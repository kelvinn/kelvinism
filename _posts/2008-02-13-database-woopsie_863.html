<p>I returned to my computer today to notice I had the following error:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">(145, "Table './databasename/comments_freecomment' is marked as crashed and should be repaired")
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Well, crap.  The solution is quite easy, however:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">mysqlcheck -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Now you know what you already know, you can fix it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">mysqlcheck -r -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>If that doesn't work, you can try a slightly different method.  First, go to the location where your databases are stored on the disk (most likely something like /var/lib/mysql/databasename).  Next, stop the database -- and try to free up as much memory as possible.  Then run:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">myisamchk -r comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>If that doesn't work, try to force it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">myisamchk -r comments_freecomment -f
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Hope that helps!</p><br />
