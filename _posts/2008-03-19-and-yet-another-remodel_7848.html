<p>I have finally decided to do another remodel of this site.  I had a few goals before starting:</p><ul><br /><li>Use one image</li><br /><li>Use the YUI-CSS framework</li><br /><li>Use Django</li><br /><li>Make it easily extendable</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>So far, I think I've accomplished these goals.  The site is easier to read, easy to modify, and has a few new features.  More entries to come!</p>
