<p>Two of my colleagues were having just a little bit <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/blog/Australia/i-caught-fish/#c1926">too much fun</a> with my blog, so I decided to have some fun back.  Over a period of 10 minutes, they managed to leave 10+ comments.  Luckily I have full control over my server, and was able to quickly create my practical joke.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">$HTTP["remoteip"] == "123.45.678.910" {
url.redirect = (
"^/(.*)" => "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck",
"" => "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck",
"/" => "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck"
)
}
</pre><br />
