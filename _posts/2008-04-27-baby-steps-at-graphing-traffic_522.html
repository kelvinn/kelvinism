You can likely tell that I've been having some fun with graphing and mapping recently.  I was reading a few articles about GIS and stumbled upon a pretty darn cool project at <a href="http://www.webopticon.com/projects/neighborhood_nets">Webopticon</a>, which included cool pictures.  I showed it to my girlfriend thinking she would find it interesting, and then realized: oh! KML has an altitude attribute.  That could be interesting.<br />
One of my projects is to create <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2007/12/sydneys-driving-habits.html" target="_blank">maps of Sydney's traffic</a><span id="goog_1862435221"></span><span id="goog_1862435222"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a>, so I have been experimenting heavily with Mapnik and OSM.  I figured I could have some fun and finally parse some gps tracks and display the data.<br />

I first started off trying to play around with the KML files my gps logger natively stores.  After a while I realized it shouldn't be this hard to parse the XML, and realized it also stores data in gpx format.  I opened up one of the gpx files and immediately saw how much easier it would be to work with.  I quickly created a parser for the xml in Python (using the dom method, yet I think I'm going to rewrite it using sax), and then with the aid of <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/584/better-python-practices-for-the-geoweb/">an article</a> by Sean Gillies, converted the needed objects into KML.  I used the speed attribute (with some magnification) as the altitude, and voila, a pretty picture.<br />
This picture is as Victoria Road crosses James Rouse Drive -- a spot that is always congested in the morning.<br />
I'll likely post some code shortly, I would like to rewrite the parsing section to use something event-driven -- hopefully it will be a little faster.
