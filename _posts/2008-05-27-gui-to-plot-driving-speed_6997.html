<p>I needed another Python fix, and I need one pretty badly.  I spent the weekend wondering why it appears to be impossible to edit the GUIDs inside an Exchange mailbox store (read: NOT the GUIDs stored in AD for Exchange).  Anyways, I digress.</p><p>My goals were simple.  I wanted to use Python, wanted something to do with traffic, and wanted to play around with Glade/PyGTK and graphing stuff.  My end result was a little app that allows you to specify a GPX file, and it plots the waypoints (and calculates the moving average!).  Pretty simple, pretty useless, but pretty fun.  I really do like pretty pictures.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qv9V1YGpNjeYA0oywW8BGA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbsbQ8Cni_yPDyZ4MPoq2GXKP-XOFmq9aEpdc3acy9aMR5QemSj4UXMS1rGJ0IUSF3yc3unogl13DXYQM9z3wD_PmGreclmzDvmaqzJlSEuHJnq-sysd-r34mpNlI1gLOFwuWuyIWfRFp8/s400/SpeedPlotrX.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>I ended up using matplotlab for the graphing part, but I don't really like how the graphs look.  I will likely use Pycha (which dips into Cairo) for my future projects -- but we'll see when that point comes.  (If data sensitivity wasn't an issue, I would totally use Google Charts, since I'm a sucker for APIs).</p>
