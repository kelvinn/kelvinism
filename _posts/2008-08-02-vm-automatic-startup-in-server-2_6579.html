<p>I think possibly one of the most practical upgrades in VMware Server 2 appears to be the ability to automatically turn on virtual machines in a stagnated order.  I have fond memories of turning on a server with 10 virtual machines, and when they all turn on at once, the hard disk grinds to a halt.  This forced me to turn on the machines manually afterwards.</p><p>+1 VMware in my books.</p><br /><br />
