<p>Using TimeVault with a shared drive as a backend is actually quite easy, but it does require a few special things setup. Note: this is gonna be a brief summary.</p><br />
<p>Install samba-tools, smbfs...</p><br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">sudo apt-get install samba-tools smbfs
</pre><br />
<p>A lot more other stuff may install as well.</p><br />
<p>Create a script that mounts your samba share.  You could also do this in fstab, but I tend to suspend my laptop when I come home, and I like clicking buttons.</p><br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">#!/bin/bash

mount -t cifs //192.168.44.2/kelvin /mnt/backups -o netbiosname=KELVIN-PC,iocharset=utf8,credentials=/home/kelvin/Apps/.smb-details.txt
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>smb-details.txt includes:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">username=DOMAIN\kelvin
password=mypassword
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Finally, create a folder called 'timevault' or something inside your mapped share, then launch TimeVault and configure it to use the above mentioned /mnt/backups/timevault folder. Configure Timevault as normal.</p><br />
