<p>Since I do sysadminy stuff all day, I don't really get a chance to do much coding (or not as much of a chance as I would like).  You can imagine my joy when my girlfriend expressed a problem she needed solved: "I'm going to need to solve 100s of slope equations, i.e. where two lines intersect.  Can you write a program to do it?"  Sure!</p><p>I asked if she wanted to do a batch input or just a one-off type of deal, she decided on the latter.  Although I've done a fair bit of PyGTK stuff, I had never actually needed to convert it to Windows.  I debated using IronPython -- but needed to use a special library to help solve the equations (I'm lazy).</p><p>So, where is the power in Python?  After about 15-20m I had a console based app that could solve the slopes.  I added the Linux GUI part in maybe 45m, and then the Windows part in, well, not 45m!</p><p>Either way, screenshot is below.  Thanks girlfriend, I had fun!</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/z7c7K2SAI4DQi84sBKkiGA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEAxIIJW4HIfuL3VFBYCY8aQM8pVChFP5qcxi3_Daaay5oN2OEJ4XstDByk-fOFICyJUfkp3Beerf12V4n3HmWFn_4WNd36bvDOFd0y5Grx6cgo5WpICpgFU5exuS0zwHrCNTaSHeuzMOt/s800/slopefinder.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />
