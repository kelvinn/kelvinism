<p>I'm always forgetting the exact string to enter at the CLI for updating the IOS on a wireless Cisco AP, so I'll just put it here to end my future searches:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">Chimp# archive download-sw /force-reload /overwrite tftp://192.168.83.150/c1100-k9w7-tar.123-8.JEC1.tar
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>192.168.83.150 obviously being your tftp server, and the .tar file sitting in the root of the tftp server.</p><p>I suppose if you wanted to backup your IOS you could do something along the lines of:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">Chimp# archive upload-sw tftp://192.168.83.150/someimage.tar
</pre><br />
<p>But I haven't tried it...</p>
