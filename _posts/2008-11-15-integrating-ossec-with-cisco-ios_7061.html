<p>I rank OSSEC as one of my favorite pieces of open source software, and finally decided to play around with it more in my own free time.  (Yup, I do this sort of stuff for <i>fun</i>).  My goal was quite simple: send syslog packets from my Cisco to my "proxy" server, running OSSEC.  I found that, although OSSEC supports Cisco IOS logging, it didn't really work.  In fact, I couldn't find any examples  or articles of anybody actually getting it to work.</p><p>I initially tried to get it to work "correctly," and soon settled to "just getting it to work."  I implemented some rules in the local_rules.xml file, which worked, but I'm pretty stubborn, and wanted to do it "correctly."  With a couple pots of tea, and the support of my girlfriend, I became much, much more familiar with OSSEC. The key (and a lot of credit) goes to Jeremy Melanson for <a href="http://www.ossec.net/ossec-list/2007-September/msg00124.html">hinting at some of the updates</a> to the decoder.xml file that need to take place.</p><p>The first step is to read the OSSEC + Cisco IOS <a href="http://www.ossec.net/wiki/index.php/PIX_and_IOS_Syslog_Config_examples#Configuring_Cisco_IOS_router">wiki page</a>.  Everything on that page is pretty straight forward.  I then added three explicit drop rules at the end of my Cisco's ACL:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">...

access-list 101 deny tcp any host 220.244.xxx.xxx log
access-list 101 deny ip any host 220.244.xxx.xxx log
access-list 101 deny udp any host 220.244.xxx.xxx log
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>(220.244.xxx.xxx is my WAN IP, and I'm sure you could figure out xxx.xxx pretty darn easily, but I'll x them out anyways).</p><p>To reiterate, OSSEC needs to be told to listen for syslog traffic, which you should be set on the Cisco. If you haven't done this, go re-read the wiki above.</p><pre class="brush: xml; light: true; "><remote>
<connection>syslog</connection>
<allowed-ips>192.168.0.1</allowed-ips>
</remote>
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>On or around line 1550 in /var/ossec/etc/decoder.xml I needed to update the regex that was used to detect the syslog stream.</p><pre class="brush: xml; light: true; ">...

<decoder name="cisco-ios">
<!--<prematch>^%\w+-\d-\w+: </prematch>-->
<prematch>^%\w+-\d-\w+: |^: %\w+-\d-\w+:</prematch>
</decoder>

<decoder name="cisco-ios">
<program_name />
<!--<prematch>^%\w+-\d-\w+: </prematch>-->
<prematch>^%\w+-\d-\w+: |^: %\w+-\d-\w+: </prematch>
</decoder>

<decoder name="cisco-ios-acl">
<parent>cisco-ios</parent>
<type>firewall</type>
<prematch>^%SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: |^: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: </prematch>
<regex offset="after_prematch">^list \d+ (\w+) (\w+) </regex>
<regex>(\S+)\((\d+)\) -> (\S+)\((\d+)\),</regex>
<order>action, protocol, srcip, srcport, dstip, dstport</order>
</decoder>

...
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>In the general OSSEC configuration file, re-order the list of rules.  I had to do this because syslog_rules.xml includes a search for "denied", and that triggers an alarm.</p><pre class="brush: xml; light: true; ">...
<include>telnetd_rules.xml</include>
<include>cisco-ios_rules.xml</include>
<include>syslog_rules.xml</include>
<include>arpwatch_rules.xml</include>
...
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Remember that these dropped events will go into /var/ossec/logs/firewall/firewall.log.  Because this is my home connection, and I don't have any active_responses configured (yet!), I tightened the firewall_rules.xml file (lowering the frequency, raising the timeframe).</p><p>And in the end, I get a pretty email when somebody tries to port scan me.</p><h4>Pretty email</h4><br />
