<p>I've had issues before with OpenFiler where doesn't update the permissions, although they appear correct in the UI.  To rectify that, I stumbled upon a one liner that fixed it.  Let's say you have a group called "Trusted" that you want to have full access to your music folder.  Here's the one-liner:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">[root@files data]# pwd
/mnt/openfiler/data
root@files data]# setfacl --recursive -m u:nobody:rwx,g:Trusted:rwx music
</pre>
