<p>I've been side-tracked on another little project, and keep coming back to NetFlow.  For this project I'll need to access NetFlow data with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, but this is a bit tricky.  First, I'm sort of lazy when it comes to my own project; maybe not lazy, I just like taking the most direct route.  The most up-to-date NetFlow collector I noticed was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>, and there is even a switch to export the information into MySQL.  Sweet!  However, I wanted to insert the flows into MySQL automatically, or at least on a regular basis.  I  first started writing a python script that would do the job, but after a few minutes noticed flow-capture had a rotate_program switch, and started investigating.  Since I somehow couldn't find anywhere instructions how to insert the data automatically, here's what I came up with:</p><p>1) Download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>; make sure to configure with --with-mysql (and you'll have to make sure you have the needed libraries).</p><p>2) Create a new database, I called mine 'netflow'.</p><p>3) Create a table that can contain all the netflow fields, a sample is below.  I added a "flow_id" field that I used as a primary key, but you don't necessarily need this.</p><pre class="brush: sql; light: true; ">CREATE TABLE `flows` (
`FLOW_ID` int(32) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
`UNIX_SECS` int(32) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
`UNIX_NSECS` int(32) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
`SYSUPTIME` int(20) NOT NULL,
`EXADDR` varchar(16) NOT NULL,
`DPKTS` int(32) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',

) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

<p>4) Setup your router so it sends netflow packets to your linux box (see README/INSTALL)</p><p>5) Create a "rotate program" that will actually enter in the information into mysql.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">kelvin@monitor:/usr/bin$ cat flow-mysql-export 
#!/bin/bash

flow-export -f3 -u "username:password:localhost:3306:netflow:flows" < /flows/router/$1
</pre>

<p>6) Create the /flows/router directory</p><p>7) Start flow-capture (9801 is the port netflow traffic is being directed to); all done.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">flow-capture -w /flows/router -E5G 0/0/9801 -R /usr/bin/flow-mysql-export
