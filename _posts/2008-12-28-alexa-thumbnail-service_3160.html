<p>Amazon offers some pretty cool services: S3, EC2, Alexa Site Thumbnail, and others.  A while back I wanted to use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ast/">AST</a> with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn't previously exist.  I even wrote up a quick <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/">tutorial</a>.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Amazon no longer maintains AST.  I've decided to <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/">archive</a> a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails.  However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including <a href="http://snapcasa.com/">SnapCasa"</a>, and <a href="http://www.websnapr.com/">WebSnapr</a>.</p>
