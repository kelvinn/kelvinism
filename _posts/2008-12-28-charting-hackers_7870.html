<p>A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot.  The majority of attacks are of the form "hello, anybody there?" -- where most people just don't answer.  But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer.  Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.</p><p>A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling.  I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving.  In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, "hello".</p><p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/attackmap/">map and explanation</a> if that sort of thing is your cup of tea.</p>
