<p>I'm not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind.  I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS.  If I had a million dollars, I'd likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to.  Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent.  I mean, the type of software where you aren't asking "I wish this could do this" and start asking "I wonder what else this can do."</p><p>While I've played around with most types of virtualization out there (OpenVZ, Xen, V-Server, qemu...), I've really found a soft spot for VMWare.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, if I was going to host a heap of Linux web servers I would absolutely use Xen, but for a heterogeneous environment, I haven't used anything as easy as VMWare's products.  Not that I judge a product by how easy it is to use, not by a long shot, but ease of use sure makes judging other factors easier.</p><p>Regardless, this isn't a post trumpeting VMWare.  I just realized tonight that some of the VMs I have running don't need to be except for certain hours of the day, or if condition A is true.  The first example is my backup mail server; I really don't need it even powered on unless my main server is down.  The second example is my Server 2003 instance, which has VI3 on it; I don't need this running unless I'm asleep.  One of the most useful resources I've seen for the vmrun command is over at <a href="http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/Controlling_VMware_Virtual_Machines_from_the_Command_Line_with_vmrun">VirtualTopia</a> -- loaded with examples.</p><h4>Turn off via time</h4><br />
<br />
<p>On my "monitoring" instance, which is always up, I've decided to install the script that controls my VM.  I've opted to use a soft shutdown.</p><p><br />
192.168.0.10 = ESXi box<br />
<br />
datastore1 = name of datastore that hosts VMs</br><br />
</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root_password stop "[datastore1] Server 2003 R2/Server 2003 R2.vmx" soft

</pre><br />
<p>I have that saved in a file called <b>stop_2003.sh</b> in /opt/vmware/bin; make sure it isn't world readable.  I also have a <b>start_2003.sh</b>:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root_password start "[datastore1] Server 2003 R2/Server 2003 R2.vmx"

</pre><br />
<p><br />
Next, edit root's crontab (crontab -e):<br />
</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># m h  dom mon dow   command
0 8 * * * /opt/vmware/bin/start_2003.sh
0 23 * * * /opt/vmware/bin/stop_2003.sh
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>The conditional task is a tad bit more tricky, but just a tad.  Ping won't do, since the mailserver could go down itself, so install nmap.  Create a script:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">#!/bin/bash

if nmap -p25 -PN -sT -oG - mail.kelvinism.com | grep 'Ports:.*/open/' >/dev/null ; then
echo `time` >> mailserver.log
else
/opt/vmware/bin/start_mail.sh
fi

</pre><br />
<p>And sticking with our theme, <b>start_mail.sh</b>:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root_password start "[datastore1] Mail Server/Mail Server.vmx"
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>This of course changes the crontab entry to:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># m h  dom mon dow   command
0 8 * * * /opt/vmware/bin/start_2003.sh
0 23 * * * /opt/vmware/bin/stop_2003.sh
*/5 * * * * /opt/vmware/bin/detect_port.sh
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>So, that's it.  detect_port.sh is lacking any type of error detection or redundancy - if one packet/scan is dropped, the mail server will turn on.  I'll re-work this at some point, but it works for now.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Vmware has also released a decent blog entry about using vmrun: <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vix/2008/12/managing-vm-guests-using-vmrun.html">on their blog</a>.</p>
