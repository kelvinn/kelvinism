<p>I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them.  I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file.  logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log -- e.g. kelvinism_access_log.  I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.</p><p>Firstly, I had to rename the actual log files.  So, to rename kelvinism_access_log to kelvinism_access.log, a one-liner:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">for x in *_log; do mv $x `basename $x _log`.log; done;
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Next, I needed to rename the log location inside each of the Apache config files.  While a one-liner might be possible, I used the following tiny script:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh

for x in *
do
sed 's/\_log/\.log/' $x > /tmp/tmpfile.tmp
mv /tmp/tmpfile.tmp $x
done
</pre>
