<p>Back in 2000 I managed to acquire several retired systems to bring to Uni: this included 4-5 cheap P120 machines.  At the time, I thought this was great; I had an OpenBSD box as my gateway, a FreeBSD box, a few Linux boxes, and likely something else that doesn't even exist now.  The school has a superfast connection, unlimited bandwidth, and I was curious.  Although I didn't really have <i>time</i>, I still managed to install and have all these servers running from my room.</p><div class="quoteboxleft">I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.</div><br /><p>Fast forward to 2007, and my mindset has changed.  In 2007 I didn't want to have 6 servers running at once, I wanted to have one server running 12 servers at once!  Thanks to Xen and VMware this was easily obtained.  Initially using Xen, and then ESXi, I had the freedom to setup Domains, tear them down, and start over.  Eventually, however, I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.  That doesn't sound like fun.  I also realized that, despite picking a motherboard and processor that could shift into low power usage, I was still using more watts than I needed to.  I was also spending way too much time mucking around with things - I want to focus on just one or two projects at a time, and I <i>really</i> want to start programming more.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NUJH80rJPtKH0NsD_ZTLxA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfWyN502_EgPg12BajqcMJbJhr9iaYe1SWLaZDGUIFaOJmPC7QXngeZtr5qlESw3l2QB7DINsCjjskut4PYYKwkOYz6N68bc3TxILX1cjiReHA5FOiK5yM2B8UTddfoOY4Yk6GxuB738/s400/ebox3300.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>Last month I finally finished the ultimate 'consolidation': I moved everything to a tiny embedded Linux box.  While back in the U.S. I contacted <a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/">WDL Systems</a> and requested for shipping costs on a tiny embedded box.  I bought the eBox-3300, with an embedded board from ICOP, and it was promptly shipped out.  After returning home to Sydney I migrated all my apps from the various virtual servers to my little box running Debian 5.0: OSSEC, Samba, Lighttpd, Asterisk and flow-tools.  The little box is just perfect for what I need - a tiny home server.  I still get around 8MB/sec transferring files, which indicates the network is still the bottleneck, and VOIP calls with Asterisk are still clear.</p><p>Overall, I've been happy with this little box.  My 'playing time' with IT has gone down significantly, my energy usage has gone down, and I now have a server I can take with me wherever I go.</p><br />
