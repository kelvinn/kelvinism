<p>I've hit this problem a few times, and figured I'd leave a note for myself how to fix it.  Ubuntu 8.04 seems to hiccup sometimes (on a VPS) for generating the correct locales.  In particular, I get this error, a lot:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Normally I just do 'dpkg-reconfigure locales', but with 8.04, this doesn't seem to do squat.  The solution is to edit the <b>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</b> file, and insert the correct locales (it will normally not exist, so create it):</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># cat /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
zh_TW.UTF-8 UTF-8
zh_TW BIG5
zh_TW.EUC-TW EUC-TW
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US ISO-8859-1
en_US.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
</pre><br />
<p>You can then do a 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' and they will be generated correctly.  For a list of supported locales, try this:</p><pre>cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED | grep US
</pre><br />
