<p><b>Update</b>: I've written up a <a href="http://kelvinism.com/howtos/installing-debian-50-vortex86dx/">short tutorial</a> on the method I used to install Debian 5.0 on this device.</p><p>A few months ago I purchased the eBox-3300 from WDL Systems.  The system was promptly shipped, and there were no "gotchas" from WDL.  The little box fit my exact needs - it is small, and built very, very well.  I flew back to Australia and, after some trial and error, installed Debian 5.0 on it.  For quite some time I was just using the vmlinuz file provided by WDL, which was provided by ICOP (DMP).  This worked well, but there were two issues:</p><br />
<br />
1) I couldn't load any modules (e.g. NFS).<br />
<br />
2) I received an annoying email from OSSEC every few hours telling me it couldn't find modules.dep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>At the end of last week I finally decided to do something about it, and considering this little box is "x86 compliant", I figured it wouldn't be too hard to create a new package.  It has been several years since I last created a self-compiled Debian-packaged kernel, so I decided to document the process for the next time I do it.  These steps are really just a summary - but if you have much Linux experience, they should be enough to guide you.  If I'm unclear, just send me an email.</p><p>Because the eBox-3300 is embedded, I logically decided to create the package on another system.  However, I wanted to maximize the chances of it working, so I installed Debian 5.0 in VirtualBox, updated it, and proceeded.</p><p>As a prep, you may need to install ncurses-dev and kernel-package in your build environment.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">apt-get install ncurses-dev kernel-package
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>1) Download latest kernel from: <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/</a></p><p>2) Download the DMP provided patch/config file for 2.6.27.3, copy it to /usr/src.  Alternatively, you can borrow my <a href="http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/config-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx">2.6.29.3 config</a>  Make a backup.</p><p>3) Untar kernel, cd into the kernel directory.  Issue:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">make menuconfig
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>4) Configure kernel.  If you used my config file, a lot of these should already be ticked.</p><br />
a) Load alternative config file, I selected mine as /usr/src/config-2.6.27.9-vortex86dx, or if you downloaded the one from me, use config-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx<br />
<br />
b) Enable generic x86 support<br />
<br />
c) Enable Kernel .config support<br />
<br />
d) Device drivers -> Network -> 10 or 100Mbit -> RDC R6040, set at built in<br />
<br />
e) Turn off generic IDE support<br />
<br />
f) Exit, make sure to save the kernel<br />
<br />
g) Verify .config exists.  If it doesn't, copy the config-2.6.x.x-vortex86dx file to .config<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>5) Create the kernel debs.  In the kernel directory, issue these commands.  This will build the kernel image, the headers, and the modules.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_source kernel_headers modules_image
</pre><br />
<p>6) Make coffee</p><p>7) Copy the debs to your running ebox by sftp (or usb, or whatever is available)</p><p>8) Install kernel in eBox-3300</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">dpkg -i linux-source-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
dpkg -i linux-headers-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>9) Reboot.  If you want my compiled kernel/sources/header .DEBs, just shoot me an email and I'll make them available.</p><p><b>Summary:</b> My only gripe about this little box was the lack of an easily customizable kernel, but no more.  I'm still very happy with this $150 purchase.</p><br />
