<p>I've had this issue happen to me several times, and I'm finally writing myself a note to fix it in the future.  There seems to be an issue with downloading VMWare Workstation (.bundle).  I first tried it with Firefox, but it just crapped out at loading it into /tmp.  Next, I tried it with Lynx, but alas, it tried to download it as a text file.</p><p>Ahah!  The quickest solution I could find is to right click the link, save as, and save it as a zip.  Rename it to .bundle when you're done.</p>
