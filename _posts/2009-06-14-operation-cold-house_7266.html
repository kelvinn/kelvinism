<p>My house is cold.  I want to start playing with simple electronics before starting <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/operation-field/">Operation Field</a>, so have created Operation Cold House.</p><p>This is just simply sticking a temperature sensor onto an Arduino, linking that up to my little home "<a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/true-consolidation/">server</a>", and uploading that to my website.  I'll display some nifty graphs, too, and link it to <a href="http://www.pachube.com/">Pachube</a>.  Stay tuned.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Complete!  The proof is <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/simple-arduino-led-tutorial/">in the</a> <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/arduino-101/">pudding</a>.  I now have a personal website from home (sorry, not public) that displays the daily and weekly temperature at home.  The process is basically like this: my little Arduino gathers the temperature, and is polled every minute with a python script via cron.  This script then sticks the time and temperature into MySQL.  It also exports the temperature to Pachube.  Every 30m I have a script that queries MySQL and uses Google's Chart's API to graph the temperature.  Looks great, I'll post a graph soon.</p>
