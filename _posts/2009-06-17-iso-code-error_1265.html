<p>I've received this error a few times when working with pytz:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">Error reading file '/usr/share/xml/iso-codes/iso_3166.xml'
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>In short, install the 'iso-codes' package in Ubuntu/Debian.  I'm sure this is covered in the manual that I didn't read, but I'm sure others didn't read it too.</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">apt-get install iso-codes
</pre>
