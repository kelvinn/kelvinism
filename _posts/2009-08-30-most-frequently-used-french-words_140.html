I'm currently studying French with my partner, and if you've read any of this site, you'll notice I'm a bit of a techie.  Often several of my interests collide, which is what happened today.  I was searching for the "most frequent french words," and while I found some lists, nothing was exactly what I wanted.<br />
My desire was to have a PDF of the top few thousand most used French words.  With the English translation next to it.  In order.  I've found some great resources, which I'll list now<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fst.ch/FST/download/347_Voc_Courant.pdf">347 most frequent French words (78% of French conversations)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_the_1750_most_frequently_used_French_words">Wiktionary entry of 1750 most frequently used French words</a></li>
</ul>
I've also found 100s of sites with 50 words or so - not exactly what I wanted.  This spawned a question for me: if I were to search a popular French newspaper website, what words would be the most frequent?  I would want to learn those first.  A few hours later, and I've compiled that list.  I'll write the details of how I did it at the end, but just know I collected over 16,000 unique words, and "read" over 80,000 words from a variety of articles.  Below is a PDF of the most popular words, ranked in order, with (maybe crappy) English translations.<br />

<br />
More to come...! I'm going to continue building the database to make sure the ranking is correct, and will make some pretty graphs when I have time.  I will also likely modify things to include what type of word it is, and an example in a sentence.<br />
