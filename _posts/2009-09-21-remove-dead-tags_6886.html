<p>I've noticed my django-tagging install has been giving a lot of empty entries when doing a lookup on a tag.  Tonight I finally got around to looking at what was causing this.  This is surely not the best way to do this, but at 12:00am on a weekday, well, I shouldn't be doing it in the first place... I first wanted to see what type of content was generating the error:</p><pre class="brush: python; light: true ">for item in TaggedItem.objects.all():
try:
print item.object
except:
print item.content_type_id
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Now that I could see what was causing it (I had removed an app that used django-tagging, but it left the tags with empty pointers).  Removing the empty tags was easy enough:</p><pre class="brush: python; light: true ">for item in TaggedItem.objects.all():
try:
print item.object
except:
item.delete()
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>No more hanging TaggedItems.</p>
