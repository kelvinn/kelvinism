For the last year YS and I have been studying French once a week (4.5hr on Saturday!)  A few months ago I wrote some Python code to read the RSS feeds of the most popular French newspaper site, and then kept track of the count of each word.  I repeated this every week for a few months.<br />
In the end I had a database of the top ~3000 words used on the site.  Today I decided I wanted to play with <a href="https://www.blogger.com/www.processing.org">Processing</a>, so created this little word collage.  It is 1680x1050, my monitor's resolution.  Two thumbs up for Processing!<br />
