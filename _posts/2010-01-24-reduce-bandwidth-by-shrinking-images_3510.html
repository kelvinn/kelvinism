<p>My girlfriend's brother has a simple WordPress-based website that I set up for him a few year ago - and he likes to post a lot of images.  For various reasons I have it hosted on my VPS in Australia, which only comes with 15GB of bandwidth, most likely because I got a crazy good deal on it.</p><p>The problem is, that isn't much bandwidth.  Each page of his site was previously using almost 10MB of bandwidth per view - which meant the 15GB was running out.  I deduced the high usage in Firebug and noticed it was *gasp* from large images, some almost 1MB large.  The images on the server are contained in subdirectories under a gallery folder - and I wanted to resize them.  What I actually wanted to do was:</p><br />
<br />
1) If the image was over 1024x900, resize it.<br />
<br />
2) If the image size (bytes) was over X, lower the quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I ended up using ImageMagick, which is what first obviously came to mind for image manipulation.  While there is likely a better way to resize all the images, this is what I came up with.  Maybe somebody else will find it useful too.</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
for dir in /home/vhosts/website.com/html/wp-content/gallery/*
do
cd $dir
for filename in *.jpg
do
echo Filename: "$filename"
width=`identify -ping -format %w "$filename"`
height=`identify -ping -format %h "$filename"`
if [ $width -ge 1024 -a $height -ge 900 ]; then
convert "$filename" -resize "%80>" "$filename"
echo New Dimensions: $width x $height 
fi
filesize=`stat -c%s "$filename"`
if [ $filesize -ge 414981 ]; then
convert "$filename" -quality 90 "$filename"
echo Old Filesize: $filesize
echo New Filesize: `stat -c%s "$filename"`
fi
done
done
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Save it as "resize.sh" and run it with "bash resize.sh".  The output:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">Filename: img_5364.jpg
