<p>Sometimes all good things <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/">come to an end</a>.  There aren't too many links going into either of these sites, but I'd like to redirect <u>all</u> of them to a page on my blog saying the website doesn't exist anymore.  I've already created simple screendumps for nostalgic purposes with the Firefox plugin Screengrab!, so the remaining simple server-side steps are:</p><ul><li>1) Edit the DNS records from the live server to the server with the notice page is on.</li>

<li>2) Create a new vhost on the server the notice exists on, add old websites as ServerAlias.</li>

<li>3) Add a redirect in the vhost to the notice about the retired sites.</li>

<li>4) Reload apache config.</li>

</ul><br />
<br />
<p>The below vhost entry will redirect any link to the retired sites to the notice page.</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; "><virtualhost *:80>
ServerName ducktracker.com
ServerAlias www.ducktracker.com blogmozaic.com www.blogmozaic.com

RedirectMatch permanent (.*)$ http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/

</VirtualHost>
