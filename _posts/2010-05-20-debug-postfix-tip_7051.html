<p>One thing I love about open source stuff is that the developers usually take great care to allow awesome debug messages.  There's a catch-22, however: how much logging to enable? Today I was creating a Postfix/Dovecot/Postgresql install and I kept getting an error message in mail.log, but it wasn't very helpful.</p><p>Luckily you can turn up the verbosity in Postfix for error messages.  You'll need to find out what component is in error, e.g. "postfix/virtual[4467]: warning:", and then open master.cf.  Add a -v to the end of the daemon that's faulting, and you'll get more logging than you know what to do with.</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">virtual   unix  -       n       n       -       -       virtual -v
</pre><br />

<p>I hope this helps somebody.  You can read more debugging tips on the Postfix <a href="http://www.postfix.org/DEBUG_README.html">DEBUG readme</a>.</p>
