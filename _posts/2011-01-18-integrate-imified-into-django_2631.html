I recently had the desire to send small updates to my so called <a href="http://www.blogger.com/about-me/">lifestream</a> page via XMPP/GTalk.  I played around with Twisted Words and several other Python XMPP clients, but I didn't really want to keep a daemon running if unnecessary.  It turns out imified took a lot of the pain out of it.  The steps for me were as follows:<br />
Create an account with imified, and create a URL, e.g. /app/api/<br />
We then configure the <b>urls.conf</b><br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true; ">urlpatterns = patterns('',   
(r'^app/api/$', bot_stream),
)
</pre>
<br />
<br />
We then create the necessary views. So, in <b>views.py</b>:<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true; ">from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from django.http import HttpResponse
from lifestream.forms import *
from datetime import datetime
from time import time

def bot_stream(request):
if request.method == 'POST':
botkey = request.POST.get('botkey')
username = request.POST.get('user')
msg = request.POST.get('msg')
network = request.POST.get('network')

if username == "username@gmail.com" or network == "debugger":
blob_obj = Blob(id=time(), body=msg, service_name="Mobile",
link="http://www.kelvinism.com/about-me/", published=datetime.now())
blob_obj.save()
resp = "OK"
else:
resp = "Wrong username %s" % username
else:
resp = "No POST data"
return HttpResponse(resp)

</pre>
<br />
<br />
To complete this little example, you can see what I used for my <b>models.py</b><br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true; ">class Blob(models.Model):
id = models.CharField(max_length=255, primary_key=True)
body = models.TextField(max_length = 1024, null = True, blank = True)
service_name = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=True, blank=True)
link = models.URLField(max_length=255, verify_exists=False, null=True, blank=True)
published = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

def __unicode__(self):
return self.id

class Meta:
ordering = ['-published']
verbose_name = 'Blob'
verbose_name_plural = 'Blobs'

def get_absolute_url(self):
return "/about-me/"

</pre>
<br />
<br />
It maybe isn't super elegant, but it works just fine, and maybe can provide a hint if somebody else is contemplating using a homebuilt xmpp solution, or just pawning it off on IMified.
