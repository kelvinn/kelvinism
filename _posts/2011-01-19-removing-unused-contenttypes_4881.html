I've been cleaning up my personal blog a bit, and I noticed that my tagging system recently broke.  I've investigated the cause, and it appears to be because I removed some apps but the contenttypes remained.  This meant that whenever I tried calling a tag with a TaggedItem that had been deleted, I was getting this error:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">'NoneType' object has no attribute '_meta'
</pre><br />
<br />
The solution is to first list all app_labels for contenttypes, and then delete any not in use.<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true; ">In [61]: from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

In [62]: for ct in ContentType.objects.all(): print ct.app_label
   ....: 
picasaweb
lifestream
readernaut
delicious
mapfeed
comments
...</pre><br />
I could then delete the unused contenttypes.<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true; ">ct_list = ["delicious", "flickr", "photologue", "twitter"]

for ct_label in ct_list:
    for ct in ContentType.objects.filter(app_label=ct_label):
        ct.delete()
    </pre><br />
<br />
And no more errors! For more details take a look at David's <a href="http://fragmentsofcode.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/cleanly-removing-a-django-app/">article.</a>
