Recently I tried editing my Cisco's ACL at home on the train. It went something like this:<br />
<ul>
<li>I logged in</li>
<li>I started updating the ACL</li>
<li>I hit a blackspot in my 3g coverage</li>
<li>My command stops at "router(config)#access-"</li>
<li>I get a call from my partner saying "what did you do to our internet!"</li>
</ul>
Although it is simple enough to just ask her to "flip the switch on the black box", I still don't like doing it. Plus, if she's not home, I'm stuck. This accident immediately reminded me of one of a trait of the 'reload' command: it can be scheduled.<br />
<br />
In the case of updating a device remotely, it is as easy as:<br />
<br />
<pre code="plain">router# reload in 2
router# conf t
router(config)# [type in desired commands]
router(config)# exit
router# reload cancel
</pre>
<br />
If the commands are entered in fine, then cancel the reload. If there is a problem, then the router will reboot and resort to the startup config.
