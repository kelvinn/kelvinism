<p>Here's a little hack I thought I'd share. There are maybe other ways to do this, but this way took all of two minutes, which suits me. My daily routine has me taking a train along the Inner West Line (here in Sydney), and I wanted to know in advance if there was any issues with the line. 131500 provides weekely emails about upcoming trackwork, and there's an RSS feed of delays; this is what you'd see in many of the Sydney transport-related apps. Another information source is through Twitter. For all of these sources I only really care about the one line I take every day - the quickest answer would seem to be if I could only get updates on Twitter for my line</p><p>Luckily this is all quick to do using an only service called <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">ifttt</a>. What I needed to do was create a task searching Twitter for "Inner West from:131500trains", and if any new items are located it sends me a message on GTalk. This is one example of what I like about having some mostly open data - I can consume it how I want it. Let's just say I'm looking forward to <a href="http://www.govhack.org">GovHack 2012</a></p><p>This example could be extended for other purposes, e.g. searching for the word "discount" on some suppliers Twitter stream.</p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8h-kPAUWTOnkLEqguXAjPtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9Xfom6wP98Yvf6jLdln-G1Pn-BE7-bzuhwgbxOA1UXaozsqANwxeldbmFVNA8y2Igl3Y0cyMjoJewdsUf-wfVt9-laeQsXMcN4JvZAh5WjKYohJJObc7qQjgcU-zy9Oaw1M6uosJ1aZmX/s400/ifttt131500trains.jpg" height="400" width="285" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pWjijYYAgM-ERMpFtAi4mdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp_IqO0pCcccUfWeS8NMSs1IQ0qu3IN-q6CUJUrBjPUvZFEp8oVkb8c_pL7H02ZZO9Q1Q3IrXAGcNZAptqYjiy53LwIMGLhcsibQXrygycJH5jgN4enwhPegaKmIp1mvS-tHYNMqU0xZ9P/s400/screenshot-1336481752845.jpg" height="400" width="240" /></a>
