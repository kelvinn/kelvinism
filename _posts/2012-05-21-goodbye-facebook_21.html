<p>I seldom used Facebook, and felt a bit depressed after logging on each time. I don't know if I am alone, but each time still felt a bit like a secret spitting contest. A bit, not a lot, but sort of subconsciously. Oh, he has a nice (sounding) job. -1 I've traveled more than her. +3  The old school cool guy is back living with his parents. +3 She has five kids already - I knew that would happen! -5 Honestly, though, even at an involuntary subconscious level, I don't like spitting contests. I would rather be sharing ideas or creating something. Wish me luck.</p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xl8h2cKY6O1qGO6FFzPUNdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZq9nMANbPfzo3PHwgsL4Be1EfRyx0pIVBjLGYTuq4SRfKR8COZ5r6KpNFA-2d41M0lB-QrQTqHxTKwC_XqNAAK8LuDxV6eaL9-QDUW7c8fWQ5Kl0MTJNvER1IOSx7uX5QVzvkY5MsGr7U/s400/fbdelete.jpg" height="167" width="400" /></a>
