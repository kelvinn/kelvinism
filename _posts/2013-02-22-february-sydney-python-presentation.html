In February I gave a presentation to about 80 people at the Sydney Python group hosted by Atlassian. Firstly, Atlassian's office was beautiful, feeling a little like Google's Sydney office, but with beer on tap instead of cereal dispensers. Secondly, the talk before me on Cython by&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/113985890803565448326/posts" target="_blank">Aaron Defazio</a>&nbsp;was exceptionally interesting, garnering lots of questions from the audience. My presentation, more of a show and tell on piping location data to Google's Latitude through App Engine, was also meant to&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;share my views on the need for innovation in the public sector (all sectors, really).<br />
<br />
My slides are below. I used very little text in the slides, but you can probably catch what is going on. The response from the audience was favourable, and I thank&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/djay75" target="_blank">Dylan Jay</a>&nbsp;for giving me the opportunity to speak.<br />
