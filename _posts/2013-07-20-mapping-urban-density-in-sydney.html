Five years ago I started exploring different mapping technologies by detailing instructions on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/04/setting-up-mapnik-server-on-ubuntu_118.html">installing Mapnik</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/11/revised-modtile-install-howto_1369.html">mod_tile</a>. Times have changed significantly in the last five years, and thanks a lot to the products offered by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">MapBox</a>. After playing with TileMill, MBTiles, Leaflet and UTFGrids, it is great how many annoyances have been fixed by MapBox. I find it enjoyable making maps now, as I no longer need to worry about patching code just to get it to run, or mucking about with oddities in web browser.<br />
<br />
Each night this week I have created a new map using Mesh Block spatial data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Mesh Blocks are the smallest area used when conducting surveys). I am thankful to live in a country that provides a certain amount of open data, and the ABS should be applauded for the amount of data they provide. They provide <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202011?OpenDocument" target="_blank">spatial data</a> about Mesh Blocks, as well as <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2074.02011?OpenDocument" target="_blank">population counts</a> for this spatial data. It is relatively easy to merge the two and then visualise them using TileMill.<br />
<br />
First up - population density of Sydney, i.e. persons reported to be living in each mesh block. Darker red indicates a higher population count.<br />

I find it interesting to see how many people live in certain Mesh Blocks. You will notice that Mesh Blocks with high population levels tend to be nearer public transport - either major roads with frequent bus service, or train stations.<br />
<br />
We can look at the urban densities by determining dwellings per hectare, and do this per Mesh Block. The definition I used for urban densities comes from <a href="http://annforsyth.net/" target="_blank">Ann Forsyth</a>&nbsp;in "Measuring Density: Working Definitions for Residential Density and Building Intensity" (<a href="http://www.corridordevelopment.org/pdfs/from_MDC_Website/db9.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>). Ann discusses the need to consider net or gross densities, depending on the type of land use. At the Mesh Block level the land use type appears to be singular: Industrial, Parkland, Commercial, Residential, and Transport. Because the land use type was generally singular I have not adjusted to gross/net, but still used Ann's definitions of certain density bands:<br />
<ul><li>Very low density: 11 dw/ha</li>
<li>Low density: 11-22 dw/ha</li>
<li>Medium density: 23-45 dw/ha</li>
<li>High density: 45 dw/ha</li>
</ul>"dw/ha" is dwellings per hectare. I decided to map the four density levels, which can be relatively easily achieved using TileMill. See below for an example.<br />

<p>You can zoom in and scroll over any Mesh Block in Sydney to find out more. Additional installation information on how I did this can be found on this special page: <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/mapping-mesh-blocks-with-tilemill.html">Mapping Mesh Block Data</a>.<br />
