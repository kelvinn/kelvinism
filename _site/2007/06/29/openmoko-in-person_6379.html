    <p>Two weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting up with some of the <a href="http://www.openmoko.org">OpenMoko</a> guys.  You've seen me write a little bit about this project, but meeting them and actually getting to play with a device was quite enlightening.</p><p>Most foreigners in Taipei take taxis, but not I.  My girlfriend gave me a rough estimate how to go to FIC headquarters, yet it was -- rough.  I jumped on the right bus, going the right direction, yet didn't really know where to get off.  In my broken Chinese I started talking to a group of high school kids, who somewhat pointed me in the right direction.  At one point we were coming up to a light and a lady just said: "get off, go down that road."  I grabbed my bag and jumped off the bus.  The street signs started to resemble the characters I had written down, but I didn't know which direction to go in.  I asked a travel agency, and they pointed me in the right direction -- and then it started to rain.  I luckily found FIC without getting too wet, and quickly met Sean, the project leader for OpenMoko.</p><p>Sean, myself, and several other OpenMoko developers went out to lunch and talked shop.  Mickey pulled out a Neo, the hardware platform OpenMoko is going to be based off of.  I'll admit, when I saw photos I wasn't really impressed -- but in person, it is pretty sexy.  Not too big, but big enough to be functional.  In one of my previous posts I mentioned learning C++ back in university, and having basically not touched it since.  In a way, I haven't had to, and I've recently found Python, which is just <i>fun</i>.  However, I'm so excited about the OpenMoko, I've picked up the K & R bible to read while we are traveling.  Not the ideal way to learn a language, but the concepts are somewhat a refresher.  I can't wait to play with SIP/IAX on this thing, it will then be my dream phone.</p><p>Well, I have one more post to make to get some thoughts off my chest.  If you want a postcard, send me an email.</p>
