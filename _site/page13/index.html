I'm currently studying French with my partner, and if you've read any of this site, you'll notice I'm a bit of a techie.  Often several of my interests collide, which is what happened today.  I was searching for the "most frequent french words," and while I found some lists, nothing was exactly what I wanted.<br />
My desire was to have a PDF of the top few thousand most used French words.  With the English translation next to it.  In order.  I've found some great resources, which I'll list now<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fst.ch/FST/download/347_Voc_Courant.pdf">347 most frequent French words (78% of French conversations)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_the_1750_most_frequently_used_French_words">Wiktionary entry of 1750 most frequently used French words</a></li>
</ul>
I've also found 100s of sites with 50 words or so - not exactly what I wanted.  This spawned a question for me: if I were to search a popular French newspaper website, what words would be the most frequent?  I would want to learn those first.  A few hours later, and I've compiled that list.  I'll write the details of how I did it at the end, but just know I collected over 16,000 unique words, and "read" over 80,000 words from a variety of articles.  Below is a PDF of the most popular words, ranked in order, with (maybe crappy) English translations.<br />
<br />

<br />
More to come...! I'm going to continue building the database to make sure the ranking is correct, and will make some pretty graphs when I have time.  I will also likely modify things to include what type of word it is, and an example in a sentence.<br />

        For this you'll need: an Arduino, an LED, a USB cable, and the Arduino software.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VUU7F7qd8doQ0pCcs88wPQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSGIXNe3gLRzm8r7ioq8niUHdBdzZBD8L9WoBp4oQAIAtlbMGaI7r3RjGzEup0sN-sZKP7E0JQuUaH9jTtPE0at4L6MK_QwduouTOIyQFyEzC2bB9U_Y8ausq1PNXwdbqUzOccLRPNg2FF/s400/arduinowLED.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br />1) Get the LED, and plug it in to your Arduino.  Plug in the long end to pin 13, plug the short end to the GND.<br /><br />2) Plug in the Arduino into your laptop. Go to Tools->Serial Port.  Choose the USB port that appears.<br /><br />3) Take the code from the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkingLED">BlinkingLED tutorial</a> and paste it in to the arduino like so: <br /><br /> <br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/9cKJq_IKgb-LMXdghLOmCg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD4UsTrzaB5lO4bVPBYinUZPyiFIUE17ygdSRy2ceZCmXOgcM_4ivrL6lho0DkZk5JbDQAmhyphenhyphenxz1bcS1FtZozT14oDmQQle0jYK5ckBOkjhbN9EBn2Oy84mTyoHcaJ7MctQWx5wBXjrQ5A/s400/arduino-LED.png" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4) Hit File->Upload to I/O Board.<br /><br />5) Hit (physically) the little reset button.

        Tonight, I'm proud to say, I've returned to childhood.  Let me explain.<br />
<div class="quoteboxright">
OK, fun over, back to work.</div>
<br />
For the last year I've been wanting to purchase an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, for no other reason than to play with.  Like a kid.  My Arduino arrived two days ago.  This is a story of problems, but not the pull-your-hair-out type, more the... like when you run out of gas in the middle of Sydney.  Going to your Christmas dinner.  In your friend's car.  Long story.<br />
<br />
As a kid I never really learned about electronics.  I took apart anything broken my parents set downstairs (and put back together the microwave I dismantled that my parent were going to give to my sister as a gift).  But no electronics.  I had a computer of some sort from when I was a wee kid, but not a single electronics kit, or not one I can remember.<br /><br />
I soon realised I forgot to order a few resistors needed for the various sensors I purchased.  This morning before work I stopped by the local electronics store, and like a kid in a candy shop, ordered $1.60 worth of resistors and LEDs.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bQknpoVRSuBRuA6fRpHGqQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi9aGnpVsYFCvX_eDS2xdoGrwAqxlHjxESlPKtgiWtsPkXLnPNZ5awjyj-evmbnad6D1Q5VibWNtCwyRviSJip4uKDos8YM_uJybO_rvKtj6q4Amggs7xJ27DZ6lyTynzn3Da5f6uTLp9PA/s400/tempcode.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Just after coming home and eating insanely good Indian with YS, I set out to get an LED blinking.  Without too many troubles, <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/simple-arduino-led-tutorial/">success</a>!  I graduated myself to the next grade and pulled out the temperature sensor.  I looked at the 'special' wires I bought to connect to the sensor and the breadboard, and I soon realised I actually purchased the M-&gt;F wires instead of the assorted pack.  I started looking around for cables I could cut.<br />
<br />
Spare USB cable, no. Telephone cable, maybe. My partner's iPod cable... and I realised I could just slice up one of the cables and see if it worked.  The cables were braided instead of solid coper, which sort of made my hopes sink, but it was too late now.<br />
<br />
I soon wired everything together as the various forum posts suggest, plugged it in to my laptop, started the Arduino software, and loaded the <a href="http://milesburton.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dallas_Temperature_Control_Library">Dallas Temperature Library</a>, and - "Invalid CRC".  I pulled the wires off, stripped a little more cabling off, plugged it back in, and tried again.  It worked!  I don't really know if the temperature is correct or not - we don't have any other way to measure it - but at this point, until I put in some more robust wires, I don't really even care.<br />
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/l1LM6Vq2tOQdvCD7HErEew?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcGg4UbKOnexsGAxg-zxeSWpiF6o8z7oo2BGMcwzkQQ5ymggVqZhZWsXw2dlsWu_0jlCqVUfW3hncFswy8dHmRbqmlwobEGAjy1ffbs5Gn8AH6oSAYC7rEw9XIe-ITBIs1RLBNsxcoDACy/s400/arduino.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Overall, I'm happy.  I've created two simple physical computing missions, and wrote two blog entries, in well under two hours.  This has been quite a relaxing break from the other duties in life.  I plan to make the little system 'proper' (more robust), and link it to my <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/true-consolidation">mini server</a>.  I'll then create a simple chart (via Google's API) to display on this website.<br />
OK, fun over, back to work.<br />

        <p>I've been looking for a simple, no-hassles GPS display program for Linux, and I believe I finally found one: <a href="http://www.tangogps.org/gps/cat/About">TangoGPS</a>.  My requirements were quite simple; I needed something that would talk to gpsd, and display a dot on OpenStreetMaps.  I've been able to do this in other programs (even in 3d in WorldWind), but I wanted something to download the maps for me, and GTK+ would be a plus.</p><p>TangoGPS was easy to install (apt-get install tangogps), and on my test 'drive' home tonight on the train, worked a treat.
