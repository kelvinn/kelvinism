<p>My house is cold.  I want to start playing with simple electronics before starting <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/operation-field/">Operation Field</a>, so have created Operation Cold House.</p><p>This is just simply sticking a temperature sensor onto an Arduino, linking that up to my little home "<a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/true-consolidation/">server</a>", and uploading that to my website.  I'll display some nifty graphs, too, and link it to <a href="http://www.pachube.com/">Pachube</a>.  Stay tuned.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Complete!  The proof is <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/simple-arduino-led-tutorial/">in the</a> <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/arduino-101/">pudding</a>.  I now have a personal website from home (sorry, not public) that displays the daily and weekly temperature at home.  The process is basically like this: my little Arduino gathers the temperature, and is polled every minute with a python script via cron.  This script then sticks the time and temperature into MySQL.  It also exports the temperature to Pachube.  Every 30m I have a script that queries MySQL and uses Google's Chart's API to graph the temperature.  Looks great, I'll post a graph soon.</p></li><li>

            Installing Debian 5.0 on Vortex86DX
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Jun 14, 2009</span>
        <p>After writing about <a href="http://kelvinism.com/tech-blog/compiling-kernel-vortex86dx/">compiling a new kernel</a> for the Vortex86DX, I've had quite a few people email me asking how I installed Debian in the first place.  The installation is actually quite straightforward, but it involved several quirky techniques.  After doing another install I decided to keep track of the process of installing Debian 5.0 on my eBox-3300.</p><p>The following guide assumes a few things.  First, you are currently using Linux and a debian variety (although instructions could be altered if using Windows).  Second, your USB shows up as /dev/sdb.  Third, your eBox-3300 has the HDD set in Native mode.  Forth, you are patient.</p><p>1) Download the custom vmlinuz and initrd.gz files from my site.  Also, download the custom deb files we'll use near the end of installation:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/vmlinuz
http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/initrd.gz
http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/linux-headers-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/linux-image-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>2) Download an i386 netinst iso:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>3) Make sure the USB has an MBR installed:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">apt-get install syslinux mtools mbr
install-mbr /dev/sdb
</pre><br />
<p>4) Format the device as FAT32 with whatever tool you like.</p><p>5) Run syslinux on it:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">syslinux /dev/sdb1
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>6) Mount the USB (or pull it out and plug it in again so it shows up on your desktop), and copy the downloaded vmlinuz, initrd, netinst.iso and deb files onto the USB.  There should be a file called ldlinux.sys already; create a file called syslinux.cfg and put the following in it:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">default vmlinuz
append initrd=initrd.gz root=/dev/rd/0 devfs=mount,dall rw DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>It should look like this:</p><img src="http://cdn.kelvinism.com/images/ebox3300files.png" alt="Ebox files" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>7) Unmount the USB, and put it in your eBox-3300.  When the system boots up initially, hit F11.  Select your USB device.  Depending how you created the MBR it might come up as saying "MBR FA:".  Press "A".  When 1234F comes up, press "1".  Press enter at the SYSLINUX "boot:" screen.</p><p>8) Proceed as normal through the menu.  It will search for an ISO image, and should detect the netinst image you inserted earlier.  When you get to the "Load installer components" section, it will complain about no kernel modules found.  Select YES.  On the next screen you shouldn't need to load any components, so hit continue.  Proceed as normal.</p><p>9) If you are ever asked about starting PC card services, hit NO.  Proceed as normal.</p><p>10) Eventually you will hit a screen that says LVM is not available, hit CONTINUE.  Proceed as normal.</p><p>11) Near the end it will toss up a list of available kernels.  Select either, it shouldn't matter.  When you are allowed to select drivers to include in the initrd, select TARGETED.  Proceed as normal.</p><p>12) You might get to a point where it says Install GRUB boot loader on a hard disk.  This will fail.  That's ok, just skip it and select "continue without boot loader".  </p><p>13) You will end up on the "Finish the installation" menu.  <b>DO NOT</b> finish!  We now need to swap out the current kernel with one that works.  Scroll down and select "Execute a shell".  Press CONTINUE. Try these steps when the shell prompt appears:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">cd hd-media
cp *.deb /target/usr/src/
cp vmlinuz /target/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.26-2.486
cp initrd.gz /target/boot/
cd /target/boot
gunzip initrd.gz
mv initrd initrd.img-2.6.26-2-486
reboot
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Your system will now reboot, and it should actually boot correctly.  However, you're using a kernel that doesn't have any headers or modules, which means you can't activate anything.  Once the box boots up, login and install the included custom kernels:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">cd /usr/src
dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
dpkg -i linux-headers-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
reboot
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Once the system comes back up, you should be running a spiffy 2.6.29 kernel, with the ability to add modules.</p><p>You may want to follow the tuning section from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microclient/web/ubuntu-on-microclient-sr">MicroClient page</a> on Google Groups.  I also modified my fstab file to help reduce wear on the CF card:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">tmpfs /var/run tmpfs defaults,noatime 0 0
tmpfs /var/lock tmpfs defaults,noatime 0 0
tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime 0 0 
</pre><br />
<p><b>Contribution 1:</b> <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/">Francois Fleuret</a> emailed through a kind reminder that the qemu-onto-SD card method is a viable option.  So, if you want to go the SD route, and have an SD reader, this might be what you're after!</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">Basically, install Debian on a SD card with qemu (start qemu with the
install disk iso as cdrom and the SD card as hda), while you are still
in qemu, download and install the kernel deb file</li><li>

        <p>I've had this issue happen to me several times, and I'm finally writing myself a note to fix it in the future.  There seems to be an issue with downloading VMWare Workstation (.bundle).  I first tried it with Firefox, but it just crapped out at loading it into /tmp.  Next, I tried it with Lynx, but alas, it tried to download it as a text file.</p><p>Ahah!  The quickest solution I could find is to right click the link, save as, and save it as a zip.  Rename it to .bundle when you're done.</p></li><li>

            Create a Movie from Images

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Jun 1, 2009</span>
        <p>I've started leaving my webcam on as a motion detector to find out who is leaving the shopping cards on our lawn, and ultimately have found it useful to stitch the images together into a movie.  There are several ways to do this - and my way maybe isn't the best - but it works for me.<p><br />
<br />
<p>I first installed and configured <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome">motion</a>, which I've used for years.  I then created a file in ~/.motion called motion.com:</p><p>$ cat ~/.motion/motion.conf</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">height 480
width 640
framerate 2
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>By creating this file, it allows me to start motion without modifying the global motion.conf file permissions, or *gasp* running it under sudo.  There are <a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigFileOptions">lots of options</a> you can put in your motion.com file.</p><p>With motion installed, and configured, now install mencoder.</p><p>I prefer to generate a seed file based on the creation date for each image.  If you try to use mencoder with just a *.jpg, it works, but my video jumped around.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">$ pwd
/home/path/Desktop/motion
$ ls -rt *.jpg > list.txt
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>This list.txt file now has the filenames, in chronological order, ready for consumption.  I create the video like so:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">mencoder mf://@list.txt -o `date +%G%m%d`.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>This will output a file with today's date in a few seconds.  Remember, the `'s are the key by the #1, not quotes.</p></li></ul>
