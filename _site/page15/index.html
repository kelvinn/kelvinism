        <p>After restoring databases from one server to another I sometimes get this error on Ubuntu or Debian:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">error: 'Access denied for user 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost' (using password: YES)'
</pre><br />
<p>This makes a lot of sense, and the solution is pretty simple.  If you look in:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
</pre><br />
<p>You'll see the defaults for your system.  Copy the password listed there, and open a connection to MySQL as root (or some other user).  Next, enter this (lets say your password specified in debian.cnf was 'abracadabra':</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">mysql> select PASSWORD('abracadabra');
+-------------------------------------------+
| PASSWORD('abracadabra')                   |

            Fixing locale errors in Ubuntu 8.04

        <p>I've hit this problem a few times, and figured I'd leave a note for myself how to fix it.  Ubuntu 8.04 seems to hiccup sometimes (on a VPS) for generating the correct locales.  In particular, I get this error, a lot:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Normally I just do 'dpkg-reconfigure locales', but with 8.04, this doesn't seem to do squat.  The solution is to edit the <b>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</b> file, and insert the correct locales (it will normally not exist, so create it):</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># cat /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
zh_TW.UTF-8 UTF-8
zh_TW BIG5
zh_TW.EUC-TW EUC-TW
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US ISO-8859-1
en_US.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
</pre><br />
<p>You can then do a 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' and they will be generated correctly.  For a list of supported locales, try this:</p><pre>cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED | grep US
</pre><br />

        <p>Back in 2000 I managed to acquire several retired systems to bring to Uni: this included 4-5 cheap P120 machines.  At the time, I thought this was great; I had an OpenBSD box as my gateway, a FreeBSD box, a few Linux boxes, and likely something else that doesn't even exist now.  The school has a superfast connection, unlimited bandwidth, and I was curious.  Although I didn't really have <i>time</i>, I still managed to install and have all these servers running from my room.</p><div class="quoteboxleft">I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.</div><br /><p>Fast forward to 2007, and my mindset has changed.  In 2007 I didn't want to have 6 servers running at once, I wanted to have one server running 12 servers at once!  Thanks to Xen and VMware this was easily obtained.  Initially using Xen, and then ESXi, I had the freedom to setup Domains, tear them down, and start over.  Eventually, however, I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.  That doesn't sound like fun.  I also realized that, despite picking a motherboard and processor that could shift into low power usage, I was still using more watts than I needed to.  I was also spending way too much time mucking around with things - I want to focus on just one or two projects at a time, and I <i>really</i> want to start programming more.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NUJH80rJPtKH0NsD_ZTLxA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfWyN502_EgPg12BajqcMJbJhr9iaYe1SWLaZDGUIFaOJmPC7QXngeZtr5qlESw3l2QB7DINsCjjskut4PYYKwkOYz6N68bc3TxILX1cjiReHA5FOiK5yM2B8UTddfoOY4Yk6GxuB738/s400/ebox3300.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>Last month I finally finished the ultimate 'consolidation': I moved everything to a tiny embedded Linux box.  While back in the U.S. I contacted <a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/">WDL Systems</a> and requested for shipping costs on a tiny embedded box.  I bought the eBox-3300, with an embedded board from ICOP, and it was promptly shipped out.  After returning home to Sydney I migrated all my apps from the various virtual servers to my little box running Debian 5.0: OSSEC, Samba, Lighttpd, Asterisk and flow-tools.  The little box is just perfect for what I need - a tiny home server.  I still get around 8MB/sec transferring files, which indicates the network is still the bottleneck, and VOIP calls with Asterisk are still clear.</p><p>Overall, I've been happy with this little box.  My 'playing time' with IT has gone down significantly, my energy usage has gone down, and I now have a server I can take with me wherever I go.</p><br /></li><li>

        <p>I like ESX.  I like Linux.  It is absurdly easy to configure Linux as an NFS server and mount it in ESXIi).</p><p><b>Installed NFS</b></p><p>I currently use Ubuntu Server for my home lab, but the process is basically the same for Red Hat and derivatives.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
</pre><br />
<p>Next, configure NFS so it can server your local LAN.  Normally you would list only specific servers, but, well, we're being cheap and dirty today. Open /etc/exports in VI or your editor of choice.</p><b>/etc/exports</b><br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">/media/disk/Images 192.168.0.0/24(rw,no_root_squash,async
</pre><br />
<p>Restart NFS.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-common
</pre><br />
Go to Configuration -> Storage -> Add Storage.<br />
<br />
Select NFS<br />
<br />
Fill in the info, see screenshot.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute.  Voila! New datastore.<br />
