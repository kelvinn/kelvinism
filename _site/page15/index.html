        <span class="post-meta">Published on May 10, 2009</span>
        <p><b>Update</b>: I've written up a <a href="http://kelvinism.com/howtos/installing-debian-50-vortex86dx/">short tutorial</a> on the method I used to install Debian 5.0 on this device.</p><p>A few months ago I purchased the eBox-3300 from WDL Systems.  The system was promptly shipped, and there were no "gotchas" from WDL.  The little box fit my exact needs - it is small, and built very, very well.  I flew back to Australia and, after some trial and error, installed Debian 5.0 on it.  For quite some time I was just using the vmlinuz file provided by WDL, which was provided by ICOP (DMP).  This worked well, but there were two issues:</p><br />
<br />
1) I couldn't load any modules (e.g. NFS).<br />
<br />
2) I received an annoying email from OSSEC every few hours telling me it couldn't find modules.dep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>At the end of last week I finally decided to do something about it, and considering this little box is "x86 compliant", I figured it wouldn't be too hard to create a new package.  It has been several years since I last created a self-compiled Debian-packaged kernel, so I decided to document the process for the next time I do it.  These steps are really just a summary - but if you have much Linux experience, they should be enough to guide you.  If I'm unclear, just send me an email.</p><p>Because the eBox-3300 is embedded, I logically decided to create the package on another system.  However, I wanted to maximize the chances of it working, so I installed Debian 5.0 in VirtualBox, updated it, and proceeded.</p><p>As a prep, you may need to install ncurses-dev and kernel-package in your build environment.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">apt-get install ncurses-dev kernel-package
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>1) Download latest kernel from: <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/</a></p><p>2) Download the DMP provided patch/config file for 2.6.27.3, copy it to /usr/src.  Alternatively, you can borrow my <a href="http://cdn.kelvinism.com/ebox/config-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx">2.6.29.3 config</a>  Make a backup.</p><p>3) Untar kernel, cd into the kernel directory.  Issue:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">make menuconfig
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>4) Configure kernel.  If you used my config file, a lot of these should already be ticked.</p><br />
a) Load alternative config file, I selected mine as /usr/src/config-2.6.27.9-vortex86dx, or if you downloaded the one from me, use config-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx<br />
<br />
b) Enable generic x86 support<br />
<br />
c) Enable Kernel .config support<br />
<br />
d) Device drivers -> Network -> 10 or 100Mbit -> RDC R6040, set at built in<br />
<br />
e) Turn off generic IDE support<br />
<br />
f) Exit, make sure to save the kernel<br />
<br />
g) Verify .config exists.  If it doesn't, copy the config-2.6.x.x-vortex86dx file to .config<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>5) Create the kernel debs.  In the kernel directory, issue these commands.  This will build the kernel image, the headers, and the modules.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_source kernel_headers modules_image
</pre><br />
<p>6) Make coffee</p><p>7) Copy the debs to your running ebox by sftp (or usb, or whatever is available)</p><p>8) Install kernel in eBox-3300</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">dpkg -i linux-source-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
dpkg -i linux-headers-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
dpkg -i linux-image-2.6.29.3-vortex86dx.deb
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>9) Reboot.  If you want my compiled kernel/sources/header .DEBs, just shoot me an email and I'll make them available.</p><p><b>Summary:</b> My only gripe about this little box was the lack of an easily customizable kernel, but no more.  I'm still very happy with this $150 purchase.</p><br />

        <p>After restoring databases from one server to another I sometimes get this error on Ubuntu or Debian:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">error: 'Access denied for user 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost' (using password: YES)'
</pre><br />
<p>This makes a lot of sense, and the solution is pretty simple.  If you look in:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
</pre><br />
<p>You'll see the defaults for your system.  Copy the password listed there, and open a connection to MySQL as root (or some other user).  Next, enter this (lets say your password specified in debian.cnf was 'abracadabra':</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">mysql> select PASSWORD('abracadabra');

            Fixing locale errors in Ubuntu 8.04

        <p>I've hit this problem a few times, and figured I'd leave a note for myself how to fix it.  Ubuntu 8.04 seems to hiccup sometimes (on a VPS) for generating the correct locales.  In particular, I get this error, a lot:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC_ALL = (unset),
LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Normally I just do 'dpkg-reconfigure locales', but with 8.04, this doesn't seem to do squat.  The solution is to edit the <b>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</b> file, and insert the correct locales (it will normally not exist, so create it):</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># cat /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
zh_TW.UTF-8 UTF-8
zh_TW BIG5
zh_TW.EUC-TW EUC-TW
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US ISO-8859-1
en_US.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
</pre><br />
<p>You can then do a 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' and they will be generated correctly.  For a list of supported locales, try this:</p><pre>cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED | grep US
</pre><br />

        <p>Back in 2000 I managed to acquire several retired systems to bring to Uni: this included 4-5 cheap P120 machines.  At the time, I thought this was great; I had an OpenBSD box as my gateway, a FreeBSD box, a few Linux boxes, and likely something else that doesn't even exist now.  The school has a superfast connection, unlimited bandwidth, and I was curious.  Although I didn't really have <i>time</i>, I still managed to install and have all these servers running from my room.</p><div class="quoteboxleft">I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.</div><br /><p>Fast forward to 2007, and my mindset has changed.  In 2007 I didn't want to have 6 servers running at once, I wanted to have one server running 12 servers at once!  Thanks to Xen and VMware this was easily obtained.  Initially using Xen, and then ESXi, I had the freedom to setup Domains, tear them down, and start over.  Eventually, however, I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.  That doesn't sound like fun.  I also realized that, despite picking a motherboard and processor that could shift into low power usage, I was still using more watts than I needed to.  I was also spending way too much time mucking around with things - I want to focus on just one or two projects at a time, and I <i>really</i> want to start programming more.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NUJH80rJPtKH0NsD_ZTLxA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfWyN502_EgPg12BajqcMJbJhr9iaYe1SWLaZDGUIFaOJmPC7QXngeZtr5qlESw3l2QB7DINsCjjskut4PYYKwkOYz6N68bc3TxILX1cjiReHA5FOiK5yM2B8UTddfoOY4Yk6GxuB738/s400/ebox3300.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>Last month I finally finished the ultimate 'consolidation': I moved everything to a tiny embedded Linux box.  While back in the U.S. I contacted <a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/">WDL Systems</a> and requested for shipping costs on a tiny embedded box.  I bought the eBox-3300, with an embedded board from ICOP, and it was promptly shipped out.  After returning home to Sydney I migrated all my apps from the various virtual servers to my little box running Debian 5.0: OSSEC, Samba, Lighttpd, Asterisk and flow-tools.  The little box is just perfect for what I need - a tiny home server.  I still get around 8MB/sec transferring files, which indicates the network is still the bottleneck, and VOIP calls with Asterisk are still clear.</p><p>Overall, I've been happy with this little box.  My 'playing time' with IT has gone down significantly, my energy usage has gone down, and I now have a server I can take with me wherever I go.</p><br /></li><li>
