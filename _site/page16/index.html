        <p>I like ESX.  I like Linux.  It is absurdly easy to configure Linux as an NFS server and mount it in ESXIi).</p><p><b>Installed NFS</b></p><p>I currently use Ubuntu Server for my home lab, but the process is basically the same for Red Hat and derivatives.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
</pre><br />
<p>Next, configure NFS so it can server your local LAN.  Normally you would list only specific servers, but, well, we're being cheap and dirty today. Open /etc/exports in VI or your editor of choice.</p><b>/etc/exports</b><br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">/media/disk/Images 192.168.0.0/24(rw,no_root_squash,async
</pre><br />
<p>Restart NFS.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-common
</pre><br />
Go to Configuration -> Storage -> Add Storage.<br />
<br />
Select NFS<br />
<br />
Fill in the info, see screenshot.<br />

Wait a minute.  Voila! New datastore.<br />

        <p>I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them.  I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file.  logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log -- e.g. kelvinism_access_log.  I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.</p><p>Firstly, I had to rename the actual log files.  So, to rename kelvinism_access_log to kelvinism_access.log, a one-liner:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">for x in *_log; do mv $x `basename $x _log`.log; done;
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Next, I needed to rename the log location inside each of the Apache config files.  While a one-liner might be possible, I used the following tiny script:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh</li><li>

        <p>I'm not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind.  I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS.  If I had a million dollars, I'd likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to.  Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent.  I mean, the type of software where you aren't asking "I wish this could do this" and start asking "I wonder what else this can do."</p><p>While I've played around with most types of virtualization out there (OpenVZ, Xen, V-Server, qemu...), I've really found a soft spot for VMWare.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, if I was going to host a heap of Linux web servers I would absolutely use Xen, but for a heterogeneous environment, I haven't used anything as easy as VMWare's products.  Not that I judge a product by how easy it is to use, not by a long shot, but ease of use sure makes judging other factors easier.</p><p>Regardless, this isn't a post trumpeting VMWare.  I just realized tonight that some of the VMs I have running don't need to be except for certain hours of the day, or if condition A is true.  The first example is my backup mail server; I really don't need it even powered on unless my main server is down.  The second example is my Server 2003 instance, which has VI3 on it; I don't need this running unless I'm asleep.  One of the most useful resources I've seen for the vmrun command is over at <a href="http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/Controlling_VMware_Virtual_Machines_from_the_Command_Line_with_vmrun">VirtualTopia</a> -- loaded with examples.</p><h4>Turn off via time</h4><br />
<br />
<p>On my "monitoring" instance, which is always up, I've decided to install the script that controls my VM.  I've opted to use a soft shutdown.</p><p><br />

        <p>A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot.  The majority of attacks are of the form "hello, anybody there?" -- where most people just don't answer.  But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer.  Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.</p><p>A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling.  I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving.  In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, "hello".</p><p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/attackmap/">map and explanation</a> if that sort of thing is your cup of tea.</p></li><li>

        <p>Amazon offers some pretty cool services: S3, EC2, Alexa Site Thumbnail, and others.  A while back I wanted to use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ast/">AST</a> with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn't previously exist.  I even wrote up a quick <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/">tutorial</a>.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Amazon no longer maintains AST.  I've decided to <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/">archive</a> a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails.  However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including <a href="http://snapcasa.com/">SnapCasa"</a>, and <a href="http://www.websnapr.com/">WebSnapr</a>.</p></li></ul>
