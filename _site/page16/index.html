        <p>I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them.  I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file.  logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log -- e.g. kelvinism_access_log.  I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.</p><p>Firstly, I had to rename the actual log files.  So, to rename kelvinism_access_log to kelvinism_access.log, a one-liner:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">for x in *_log; do mv $x `basename $x _log`.log; done;
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Next, I needed to rename the log location inside each of the Apache config files.  While a one-liner might be possible, I used the following tiny script:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">#!/bin/sh</li><li>

        <p>I'm not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind.  I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS.  If I had a million dollars, I'd likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to.  Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent.  I mean, the type of software where you aren't asking "I wish this could do this" and start asking "I wonder what else this can do."</p><p>While I've played around with most types of virtualization out there (OpenVZ, Xen, V-Server, qemu...), I've really found a soft spot for VMWare.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, if I was going to host a heap of Linux web servers I would absolutely use Xen, but for a heterogeneous environment, I haven't used anything as easy as VMWare's products.  Not that I judge a product by how easy it is to use, not by a long shot, but ease of use sure makes judging other factors easier.</p><p>Regardless, this isn't a post trumpeting VMWare.  I just realized tonight that some of the VMs I have running don't need to be except for certain hours of the day, or if condition A is true.  The first example is my backup mail server; I really don't need it even powered on unless my main server is down.  The second example is my Server 2003 instance, which has VI3 on it; I don't need this running unless I'm asleep.  One of the most useful resources I've seen for the vmrun command is over at <a href="http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/Controlling_VMware_Virtual_Machines_from_the_Command_Line_with_vmrun">VirtualTopia</a> -- loaded with examples.</p><h4>Turn off via time</h4><br />
<br />
<p>On my "monitoring" instance, which is always up, I've decided to install the script that controls my VM.  I've opted to use a soft shutdown.</p><p><br />

        <p>A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot.  The majority of attacks are of the form "hello, anybody there?" -- where most people just don't answer.  But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer.  Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.</p><p>A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling.  I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving.  In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, "hello".</p><p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/attackmap/">map and explanation</a> if that sort of thing is your cup of tea.</p></li><li>

        <p>Amazon offers some pretty cool services: S3, EC2, Alexa Site Thumbnail, and others.  A while back I wanted to use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ast/">AST</a> with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn't previously exist.  I even wrote up a quick <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/">tutorial</a>.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Amazon no longer maintains AST.  I've decided to <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/">archive</a> a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails.  However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including <a href="http://snapcasa.com/">SnapCasa"</a>, and <a href="http://www.websnapr.com/">WebSnapr</a>.</p></li><li>

            NetFlow into MySQL with flow-tools

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Dec 21, 2008</span>
        <p>I've been side-tracked on another little project, and keep coming back to NetFlow.  For this project I'll need to access NetFlow data with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, but this is a bit tricky.  First, I'm sort of lazy when it comes to my own project; maybe not lazy, I just like taking the most direct route.  The most up-to-date NetFlow collector I noticed was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>, and there is even a switch to export the information into MySQL.  Sweet!  However, I wanted to insert the flows into MySQL automatically, or at least on a regular basis.  I  first started writing a python script that would do the job, but after a few minutes noticed flow-capture had a rotate_program switch, and started investigating.  Since I somehow couldn't find anywhere instructions how to insert the data automatically, here's what I came up with:</p><p>1) Download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>; make sure to configure with --with-mysql (and you'll have to make sure you have the needed libraries).</p><p>2) Create a new database, I called mine 'netflow'.</p><p>3) Create a table that can contain all the netflow fields, a sample is below.  I added a "flow_id" field that I used as a primary key, but you don't necessarily need this.</p><pre class="brush: sql; light: true; ">CREATE TABLE `flows` (
`FLOW_ID` int(32) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
`UNIX_SECS` int(32) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
`UNIX_NSECS` int(32) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',

<p>4) Setup your router so it sends netflow packets to your linux box (see README/INSTALL)</p><p>5) Create a "rotate program" that will actually enter in the information into mysql.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">kelvin@monitor:/usr/bin$ cat flow-mysql-export
