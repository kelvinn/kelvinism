        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Jul 25, 2020</span>
        There are a lot of books on parenting. Before my daughter was born I read a book on pregnancy, one of those 500 pages texts from a high class place - Mayo Clinic or Harvard or something like that. It was helpful, but given I can't even remember the name, clearly not something that I considered life changing.<div><br /></div><div>However, after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Million-Words-Building-Childs-ebook/dp/B00SI02BHE" target="_blank">Thirty Million Words: Building a Child's Brain</a> I was all hyped up to drown my new kid in words. We travelled a lot when she was young, so didn't have a lot of books, but she sure had them read to her. When I took a year off as a stay-at-home-dad I kept having those 30 million words ticking in my mind. By the time she was 2 1/2 she was getting five books read to her a night. By the time she was around 3 1/2 she was listening to Amazon Story Time for an hour every evening.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also around 3 she started playing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/khan-academy-kids/id1378467217" target="_blank">Khan Kids</a>, and could play it for ages if I let her. There was no doubt that she enjoyed learning, and it was lovely to see her take each new step.</div><div><br /></div><div>She entered Kindy when she was about 4 1/2, so one of the younger kids. Her school was teaching them how to read by having them sound out words, look for clues, but also to just brute force a few 100 of the most frequently used words. These were called "sight words", and knowing them supposedly speeds up their comprehension for easier texts, which left more energy for the words they didn't know. Sounds good to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>Without getting into too much detail, the first part of the year was quite challenging for us. At one point I realised I wasn't really helping her as much with her school work as I could have, and while she certainly wasn't falling behind, I also knew she had extra potential that wasn't being explored.</div><div><br /></div><div>Given all this background, I started to take her sight words seriously. I bought a laminator and made her little flash cards, and put in place some low-fi&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>, so she wouldn't need to go over 100s of easy words every day. This meant we could go over the "known" words on the weekend, and the less well known words over breakfast.</div><div><br /></div><div>The system works like this: a new sheet gets made and we play a little game where a subset of the cards gets put on the table, and I shout out a word. She finds the word, and we put it in the "learn" bag. Sometimes she knows it, and sometimes needs to sound it out.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgj_K68MBmpwxT2waW41XAw6j2FSwUtV_u7bQuOhCYhrtgEg9YegVuQ0N0jWKnBththUEW3Xt-n-Tv4yiSEHRQh1oYqZEPQcD3OUeycFnwg_CWBtzLAEuSqAMyAlOHrCyKDX2qeHQoknyp8/s640/IMG_4893.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Learning New Words" border="0" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" height="469" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgj_K68MBmpwxT2waW41XAw6j2FSwUtV_u7bQuOhCYhrtgEg9YegVuQ0N0jWKnBththUEW3Xt-n-Tv4yiSEHRQh1oYqZEPQcD3OUeycFnwg_CWBtzLAEuSqAMyAlOHrCyKDX2qeHQoknyp8/w625-h469/IMG_4893.jpeg" width="625" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Learning New Words<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>This is pretty easy for her, for example, if I say "give" then she knows only one word starts with a "g", so chooses that.

If she gets it right a few times and clearly has instant recall, then it goes in the "young" bag.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjc5NQYQfgo36Y1dTMvcNn5m-FYoPjYgeQ8Hbwsq97MWxptuFDG8rAXd9CrDyXPTANxjavYTnaYk2tbLSr4BG_55hA7jBTY8olf0LRkLxe186msI0IOXVxPFnxMHwK5hPxgWPLhLx1aFz8C/s640/IMG_4892.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" height="469" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjc5NQYQfgo36Y1dTMvcNn5m-FYoPjYgeQ8Hbwsq97MWxptuFDG8rAXd9CrDyXPTANxjavYTnaYk2tbLSr4BG_55hA7jBTY8olf0LRkLxe186msI0IOXVxPFnxMHwK5hPxgWPLhLx1aFz8C/w625-h469/IMG_4892.jpeg" width="625" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Getting Mastery<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>After she gets it right a few more times, then the card goes in the "mature" bag.</div><div><br /></div><div>We do the "learn" bag every breakfast, and the "young" bag every few breakfasts. We do the "mature" bag usually on the weekend or on a Monday morning. If she gets a word wrong, then it goes the other way (e.g. from "mature" back in to "young" or directly to "learn" again).</div><div><br /></div><div>I am really impressed with her school, as most of the kids in kindergarten seem like they can read. Although some of the kids know more sight words than her that's not the point; she has an easier time reading, and I sometimes hear her reading to herself in her room.</div><div><br /></div><div>One thing to note is that she gets no rewards for doing her sight words, but there are almost never any complaints. However, we do have an agreement that when she can read a "level 5" book, which I think is about a grade 4 book, then I will buy her a copy of Harry Potter and we will each read a copy. I can't wait!</div></li><li>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Background</h2><div><br /></div>I have two first aid kits: one that is in my bag when I go to work, and another when I go hiking. The one in my bag has more stuff in it, but overall the contents are pretty similar. In particular with the hiking kit I am only carrying what is likely to be used, items that cannot be improvised with what I can find, and items that I know how to use. It would be easy to <i>pack my fears</i>&nbsp;and include a&nbsp;tourniquet or triangle bandage or EpiPen, but if I allowed myself to fear that level of risk I would also wear a helmet while walking across crosswalks. The reality is I am much more likely to get blisters, minor cuts, and lots of sore muscles.<div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Drugs</h2><div><br /></div><div>So, what's it in my kit?

            Overland Track Lighter Pack Tips
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Jun 2, 2019</span>
        <h2 style="line-height: 1.5;">
Background</h2><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div>
My hiking companion and I recently completed the Overland Track in Tasmania, and she posted a picture of our packs on a related group on Facebook. There was an overwhelming response, ranging from <i style="line-height: 1.5;">good job!</i>&nbsp;to <i style="line-height: 1.5;">you're a liar</i>&nbsp;or <i style="line-height: 1.5;">you surely didn't have a tent</i>&nbsp;or <i style="line-height: 1.5;">you must be on a tour and didn't bring food</i>.<br />
<br />
I can understand the skepticism. Upon inspecting what people brought, and never used, there is definitely a preference for people to <i style="line-height: 1.5;">pack their fears</i>. Considering this track seemed to be the first time many people have done a multi-day backpacking trip, there were a lot of things they likely would not pack after gaining a little more experience.<div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 1.5;">The consequences were very real. Most people had knee or foot problems by the time they reached Narcissus Hut, and I was one of only a few people able to hike out (~18km) when the ferry was cancelled (made it in about 3hr 45min and made my transport). One of my more lasting memories from the hike was stumbling on a couple hiking and one of the people being&nbsp;<i style="line-height: 1.5;">unable to cross a fallen tree because their bag was too heavy</i>, and their partner had to help push them up.<br />
<br />The track was likely especially scary for newcomers given the weather we encountered was "the worst so far this season", according to our track transport. A week before we went the weather was supposed to be six days of glorious 5 - 10 C temperatures with only a little drizzle. The night before we flew out of Sydney it was forecasted to snow 1 - 2 mm one of the days. The actual weather was non-stop rain or snow, temperatures ranging from -2 to 3 C, and we only saw blue sky once. Once. I don't remember ever seeing the sun from start-to-finish. It felt like we spent more time walking in streams or mud than on actual dry soil.<div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody style="line-height: 1.5;"><tr style="line-height: 1.5;"><td style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm0Mgrv8Ar92ho2go3BgsNLgOllPYRQxdt97y4g6FTnV-FqvWqmyabvABz86yCSC3KsIyQYysk_b9p89NeaHWOV8H9USe1KjyxOfF3usYH0oE6yYCECSnW0-YM3UMV1Uo8oKS4BCAoq0Mq/s2944/Overland.png" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2640" data-original-width="2944" height="574" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm0Mgrv8Ar92ho2go3BgsNLgOllPYRQxdt97y4g6FTnV-FqvWqmyabvABz86yCSC3KsIyQYysk_b9p89NeaHWOV8H9USe1KjyxOfF3usYH0oE6yYCECSnW0-YM3UMV1Uo8oKS4BCAoq0Mq/w640-h574/Overland.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr style="line-height: 1.5;"><td class="tr-caption" style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;">The Overland Track. Plan ahead and say goodbye to mobile reception.</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br />Given we encountered just about the worst the trail could throw at us outside of winter, how do we know we brought just the right amount of stuff?</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;">
<br />
1) We were one of only two parties from our van transport that even stayed in our tent<br />
2) We never shivered a single time, nor did we think we were ever in any danger<br />
3) The ferry was cancelled when we rolled in to Narcissus Hut, so 16 extra people had to stay overnight; about five of them didn't have enough food, and we were the ones giving them food because we had plenty of food remaining (that said, we were also 1 1/2 days ahead of schedule)<br />
4) People routinely borrowed our lighter, as the&nbsp;piezo on their stove was broken<br />
5) We had hot meals every night, coffee twice a day, and still had fuel left over<br />
6) We let three people charge their phones at NH so they could sort out travel arrangements, as they didn't have a spare power bank<br />
<br />
<h2 style="line-height: 1.5;">
Suggestion From What We Saw</h2>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Here's a list of things that we saw people bring, but with suggested substitutes that would reduce overall weight while not reducing safety or comfort. You might think "that's only 50g savings", but it all adds up. We had by far the lightest bags with a total pack weight of around 8 kg (with 1 litre of water), and the heaviest in our van was 23kg. Most were around 15kg.</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
<h3 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5;">
Camp Shoes</font></h3><div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Seen Brought: 2nd pair of sneakers for camp shoes</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Better: Crocs/Flip-Flops or hotel slippers</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Best: Plastic bags</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
<br /></div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
A lot of people brought a 2nd pair of sneakers just for walking around the huts. Many people were a little more wise and brought a lighter pair of Crocs (good for socks, but mine weight 349g) or flip-flops (mine weigh 155g), but I'd argue that hotel slippers (mine weigh just 39g) serve the same purpose. Or bring two bread bags and when you get to the hut take off your wet socks, put them immediately on or near the heater, put on your sleep socks, and put on bread bags on top of them. You can then wear your wet shoes without getting your sleep socks wet.</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div>
<h3 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5;">
Fresh Fruit / Veggies</font></h3><div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Seen Brought: Fresh Fruit/Veggies</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Better: Dried fruit / dehydrated veggies</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Best: None</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
<br /></div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Feel free to bring a fresh apple for lunch the first day, but fresh fruit is extremely heavy for the calories they provide. We saw people four days in giving away cucumbers / zucchini. To put this in perspective, 100g of cucumbers have 72 calories vs. 100g of peanut m&amp;m have 516 calories.</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5;">
Tinned Food</font></h3><div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Seen Brought: Cans of tuna</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Better: Starkist tuna packets</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
Best: Jerkey or biltong or just nuts or peanut butter m&amp;m</div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
<br /></div>
<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
On my first multi-day hike several years ago with this hiking companion my shopping instructions where: if it has to cook, then it needs to be able to be done in less than 3 minutes, and no cans or jars of anything. Bringing in a can of tuna, which isn't even that calorie dense to begin with, means you have to keep carrying that tin your entire hike. If you must bring in a tuna packet, but do a little research, as you can save significant weight by paying attention to the food you bring. Please see <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/the-5000-calories-per-day-wilderness-diet/" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">Skurka's post</a>&nbsp;for some overall tips, and then over at <a href="https://www.greenbelly.co/pages/best-high-calorie-backpacking-foods" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">Greenbelly</a> for some actual food/weight breakdown. Please see below for our food breakdown. We deviated a little bit in what we ended up buying in TAS (e.g. no banana chips), but it was plenty. If you have the time, and like planning, then consider doing the same. Alternatively, and this is the guideline I follow if I do not intend to do much planning, then try to buy food at Woolies or Coles that is as close to 2000kJ per 100g as possible.</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody style="line-height: 1.5;"><tr style="line-height: 1.5;"><td style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnAZ7YTMY2IPOiJ9Rp9vP2TD50Y2IqEgzXPuhDdkytuSLqqN5k0n2jnTy0FJBmkvD4rjvrSzzbNifYGTB9564QNDi_5x-jS8RpOchUDGeMqw3MKc80qB6heI5_Wp09ue3Qen4huqah9gdA/s2028/Food.png" style="line-height: 1.5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1180" data-original-width="2028" height="372" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnAZ7YTMY2IPOiJ9Rp9vP2TD50Y2IqEgzXPuhDdkytuSLqqN5k0n2jnTy0FJBmkvD4rjvrSzzbNifYGTB9564QNDi_5x-jS8RpOchUDGeMqw3MKc80qB6heI5_Wp09ue3Qen4huqah9gdA/w640-h372/Food.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr style="line-height: 1.5;"><td class="tr-caption" style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;">Initial food planning for two<br /></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><h3 style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;"><font size="5" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.5;">Tools / Kitchen Stuff</font></h3><div style="line-height: 1.5;">Seen Brought: Small cast iron skillet, hunting knives</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;">Better: Not a cast iron skillet</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><div style="line-height: 1.5;">A lot of people were cooking pretty elaborate meals, which is pretty impressive. They also brought four pans and three canisters of fuel. I hesitate making recommendations on food, but I'd probably suggest getting some dehydrated meals from Snowys a few weeks in advance, and you won't need all those pots and pans. Another nice thing is you can use the package as a container, so one less bowl to bring and clean.

TAS Parks provides a list of minimum gear that you need to bring, but I don't think you need to bring more than what is on it. Even better would be to read the article by Andrew Skurka on the Core 13 items he suggests you bring. We surprisingly saw quite a bit of cotton shirts / pants being worn, which was a surprise.</div><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div>

        I recently purchased an Echo from Amazon, and we were contemplating how else to better integrate it with our somewhat minimalistic home. I thought it would be interesting to get it to link to a WiFi-enabled power outlet, but unfortunately they are pretty expensive in Australia.<br />
<br />
Then I stumbled across the <a href="http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/" target="_blank">Sonoff</a>&nbsp;devices by Itead, and learned that they were somewhat hackable via a <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota" target="_blank">custom firmware</a>. Coincidentally I received the two devices on the same day my daughter was off sick, so when she had her nap, I got hacking.<br />
<br />
The first bottleneck was discovering that the units I received did not have any headers. A little quick soldering later, and we had headers.<br />
<br />

A few notes of warning: the $2 programmer I got from AliExpress has 3.3v and 5v, but the <i>output</i>&nbsp;is 5v. I'm glad I measured it with my multimeter, and used a random 3.3v breadboard supply instead.<br />
<br />
In hindsight I wish I had just purchased the <a href="https://www.itead.cc/foca.html" target="_blank">FTDI programmer</a> from Itead. It looks pretty neat.<br />
<br />
After following the rest of the Tasmoto <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Sonoff-S20-Smart-Socket" target="_blank">hardware instructions</a>, and then the <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Upload" target="_blank">PlatformIO instructions</a>, I was able to successfully flash both my units with the custom firmware.<br />
<br />
I then created a Lambda function that sends a signal to CloudMQTT, and connected the two devices.<br />
<br />
Voila!<br />

            Geocoding Photos (Mac)
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Dec 13, 2014</span>
        I've recently started using OSX (again), and am really enjoying it (again). One Windows-only tool that I found really useful is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geosetter.de/en/" target="_blank">Geosetter</a>, which allows you to add geo coordinates into photos. There don't appear to be any free geocoding tools that work to my satisfaction to do this, so the next best thing was geocode like you would using Linux. Here's how.<br />
<br />
We're going to use the command line program <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/" target="_blank">ExifTool</a> (by Phil Harvey) to extract coordinates from a gpx file and embed them in a directory of images.<br />
<br />
Firstly, install exiftool using <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew</a>. Here's the command:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">brew install exiftool
</pre>
<br />
Copy the gpx files into your image directory and initiate the sync with the geotag flag:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">exiftool -geotag=gpslog2014-12-10_212401.gpx ./
</pre>
<br />
It is possible to also specify multiple gpx files (e.g. multiple day trip):<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">exiftool -geotag=gpslog2014-12-10_212401.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-07_132315.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-08_181318.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-10_073811.gpx ./
</pre>
<br />
And finally, you can include a time offset with the geosync flag. For instance, I had an 11-hour (39600 seconds) difference due to a timezone hiccup with my new camera, so we can get rid of that:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">exiftool -geotag=gpslog2014-12-10_212401.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-07_132315.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-08_181318.gpx -geotag=gpslog2014-12-10_073811.gpx -geosync=39600 ./
</pre>
<br />
It will process the images, renaming the original with an ".original" extension, and give you a report at the end:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">1 directories scanned
193 image files updated
83 image files unchanged
</pre>
<br />
If your camera is set to GMT, then put all the GPX files in the same directory as the photos to geocode, and do this:<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">TZ=GMT exiftool -geotag "*.gpx" *.jpg
</pre>
<br />
For any additional manual geocoding I fallback on <strike>Picasa's Places</strike>&nbsp;<a data-jsbanchorprepared="DbMHD3VqBP0TPju" href="http://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/" target="_blank">GeoTag</a>&nbsp;to add the coordinates.<br />
<br />
If you have Lightroom, then try doing a search for a suitable ExifTool Lightroom plugin, as there seem to be a few.</li></ul>
