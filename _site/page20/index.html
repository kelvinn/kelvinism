            Using Raw Disks with VMware Server 2
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Aug 11, 2008</span>
        <p>For various reasons I had the need to open a raw disk inside VMware Server 2.  The reports from the field say that this just isn't supported. Although I don't need to actually run a raw disk, I needed to get some data off it -- 400GB worth.  It turns out 'not supported' really means 'not in the UI.'  I don't know the reason why it isn't in the UI, maybe marketing wants people to use ESX, or maybe the UI guys fell behind with their workload.</p><p>Alas, it is possible.  And here's how.</p><br />
<br />
1) Take out your 'raw disk' and put it into another machine.<br />
<br />
2) Fire up Server 1.0.x or Workstation and open a virtual machine (or create a new one).  Edit the preferences and add a new hard disk.  Select 'use a physical disk', and select the disk you put in above.  Select use entire disk.  You may want to change the SCSI LUN to SCSI1:0 (depending how many disks are in your 'proper' server).<br />
<br />
3) Save it as something like 500GB.vmdk<br />
<br />
5) Copy out the relevant bit from the vmx file, e.g.<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># Test VM.vmx
scsi1.present = "TRUE"
scsi1:0.present = "TRUE"
scsi1:0.fileName = "500GB.vmdk"
scsi1:0.deviceType = "rawDisk"
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>And of course, the entire 500GB.vmdk file</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "># 500GB.vmdk
# Disk DescriptorFile
version=1
CID=7e245252
parentCID=ffffffff
createType="fullDevice"</li><li>

        <p>I think possibly one of the most practical upgrades in VMware Server 2 appears to be the ability to automatically turn on virtual machines in a stagnated order.  I have fond memories of turning on a server with 10 virtual machines, and when they all turn on at once, the hard disk grinds to a halt.  This forced me to turn on the machines manually afterwards.</p><p>+1 VMware in my books.</p><br /><br /></li><li>

        <p>Installing the tools in VMware Server 2 is a little different than Workstation or the previous versions of VMware Server.  Under the Summary tab of your Virtual Machine, look for a link that says "Install VMware Tools" -- click it.</p><p>Wait for 'Success' to show up on the bottom, and jump into your virtual machine.  Mount the tools as so:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>And install as normal (copy the .tar.gz to /usr/src, extract it, install it).  Easy peasy.</p></li><li>

            Ubuntu 8.04 64-Bit and VMware Server 2
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Aug 1, 2008</span>
        <p>I now have successful installation of VMware Server 2 (Beta RC1) on top of Ubuntu 8.04 64-bit.  I have been using various virtualization technologies for years, and VMware is usually the easiest to install and configure.  So far, VMware Server 2 RC1, has proven to be the exception to the rule.</p><p>That said, I am very excited by the direction VMware is taking -- this new server version looks to have great potential.<p><br />
<br />
<p>The 'server' this is on is a mATX motherboard from Gigabyte (GA-G33M-DS2R), with 4GB (2x2GB) of Transcend DDR2-800 memory, topped off with the E8200.  I have been nothing but impressed with this combination of hardware.</p><p>However, although I was thinking VMware Server 2 would install seamlessly over Ubuntu, I was wrong.  There were a few things I had to tweak to get everything working correctly.</p><p>The first thing I had major issues with was VMware choking on the parallel port.  Normally the parport is the first thing I would turn off, but in this instance, I guess excitement overtook me.  My tip is to first remove the lp module from inside /etc/modules, and then disable the parallel port inside the BIOS.  The symptoms I was having involved VMware halting/freezing on either startup or shutdown.  This occurred for both RC1 as well as 1.0.6.</p><p>My second tip, if VMware freezes half way through starting up or shutting down, is to go through the vmware startup script, /etc/init.d/vmware, and comment out anything refering to the parport_pc.  In particular, I looked for this line and made sure to comment it out:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">/sbin/modprobe -r parport_pc >/dev/null 2>&1
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>I commented out lines 974 and 1076.  After doing this, VMware loaded perfectly.</p><p>The second major issue I had occurred after actually installing VMware.  I opened Firefox and went to the IP of my virtual server, logged in just fine, and loaded up my first virtual machine.  However, after booting the virtual machine, I was unable to open up the remote console.  It turns out I had just upgraded to Firefox 3.0.1, and the Remote Console is set to fail on anything above 3.0.0.1.  The fix is quite easy.</p><p>First click where it says "click anywhere to open the virtual machine".  Copy the address of the XPI and use something like wget to download the file.  This is an example:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">wget --no-check-certificate https://192.168.50.10/ui/plugin/vmware-vmrc-linux-x86.xpi
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>If you are using Gnome, right click the file you just downloaded and say Open With then Archive Manager.  Do the same for the 'install.rdf' file inside, specifying gedit as the application if need be. Next, edit line 20 so it reads as follows:</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "><em:maxVersion>3.0.*</em:maxVersion>
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Save the file, open the XPI with Firefox, and you should be good to go.</p><p>I've seen a lot of other suggestions on the 'net on how to fix VMware RC1 when booting -- including disabling ipv6, checking the hosts file, and running the any-any patches.  None of these approaches helped me at all, but maybe it is exactly what you need.  My biggest tip is that if VMware isn't starting up or stopping correctly, open up /etc/init.d/vmware and find out exactly where it is faulting (add things like 'echo "fail"' inside the IF statements).</p></li><li>

        <p>I needed another Python fix, and I need one pretty badly.  I spent the weekend wondering why it appears to be impossible to edit the GUIDs inside an Exchange mailbox store (read: NOT the GUIDs stored in AD for Exchange).  Anyways, I digress.</p><p>My goals were simple.  I wanted to use Python, wanted something to do with traffic, and wanted to play around with Glade/PyGTK and graphing stuff.  My end result was a little app that allows you to specify a GPX file, and it plots the waypoints (and calculates the moving average!).  Pretty simple, pretty useless, but pretty fun.  I really do like pretty pictures.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qv9V1YGpNjeYA0oywW8BGA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbsbQ8Cni_yPDyZ4MPoq2GXKP-XOFmq9aEpdc3acy9aMR5QemSj4UXMS1rGJ0IUSF3yc3unogl13DXYQM9z3wD_PmGreclmzDvmaqzJlSEuHJnq-sysd-r34mpNlI1gLOFwuWuyIWfRFp8/s400/SpeedPlotrX.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>I ended up using matplotlab for the graphing part, but I don't really like how the graphs look.  I will likely use Pycha (which dips into Cairo) for my future projects -- but we'll see when that point comes.  (If data sensitivity wasn't an issue, I would totally use Google Charts, since I'm a sucker for APIs).</p></li></ul>
