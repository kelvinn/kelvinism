        <p>I returned to my computer today to notice I had the following error:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">(145, "Table './databasename/comments_freecomment' is marked as crashed and should be repaired")
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Well, crap.  The solution is quite easy, however:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">mysqlcheck -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Now you know what you already know, you can fix it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">mysqlcheck -r -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>If that doesn't work, you can try a slightly different method.  First, go to the location where your databases are stored on the disk (most likely something like /var/lib/mysql/databasename).  Next, stop the database -- and try to free up as much memory as possible.  Then run:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">myisamchk -r comments_freecomment
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>If that doesn't work, try to force it:</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">myisamchk -r comments_freecomment -f
</pre><br />
<br />
<p>Hope that helps!</p><br />

        <p>Yesterday I was sort of curious if I could use my 3 Skypephone in a pinch if I got lost, which here in Sydney, happens quite often.  Luckily 3's Skypephone has both Bluetooth, and supports j2me apps.  Mobile GPS unit, here I come.</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3AY6h-qKwGk9NpnB9hrwsw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjExWMS7zKJdGCG_1MHdpb900yTseLCrbHerf2PlfzwSouqfnmJHr5V1jiIcDcbMrEul2OZUFlCYOQhTgrq_3C-cYDWmxkx-yDOr6NNwokX8P-gUikt3DSjxRi11qJrMuP4_aSRLpjhLPax/s288/DSC03368.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>The recipe to get maps on your Skypephone is pretty darn easy.  You'll need one dash bluetooth GPS receiver (I have the <a href="http://www.qstarz.com/Products/GPS%20Products/BT-Q1000.html">Qstarz BT-Q1000</a>), <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/index.php">TrekBuddy</a>, a TrekBuddy acceptable map (<a href="http://osm.bandnet.org/browse/?1,1,1,0">easily downloadable</a>), and one dab computer -- but since you're reading this, I figure you've got that part taken care of.</p><p>My process is as follows (on Linux): plug in your Skypephone and select "usb storage" on your phone.  Drag the TrekBuddy.jar file onto your new mounted drive (mine comes up as KINGSTON).  Drag a relevent map downloaded from bandnet.org onto your phone as well.  Unplug your phone from the USB, and it will scan for new media.  Hit Menu -> My Stuff -> Others and scroll down to treckbuddy.jar -- hit Run.  Go to your Connectivity settings and turn on bluetooth.  Next go to Games and Apps and downloaded apps, start TrekBuddy.  Press the key above MENU and select Load Map, and choose the map you uploaded to your phone.  Now hit Start.  Select the GPS device, and you're in business!</p><p>There are more instructions <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=91">here</a> and also <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22">here</a>.</p></li><li>

        <p>I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OSM</a> a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map.  At first I wanted to do it on my VPS -- but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn't a way.  Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database.  Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn't have (although I'm writing some code that might make this possible in the future).</p><p>The second problem exists with CPU usage.  Processes on my VPS don't really utilize the CPU much, which means renicing the process doesn't do a thing.  The CPU pegs at 100%, as it is supposed to do, except that the VPS auto-kills processes that stay at 100% for any length of time.  Luckily somebody wrote a program called "cpulimit" (apt-get install cpulimit) that will cap the CPU usage for a process.</p><p>The last problem that I thought about is <i>what if</i> I could uncompress the file.  Would that use less memory to stick it in the database?  I searched and searched but couldn't find an answer to how big the actual .osm file is.  I ultimately broke down and decided to spend the 50c it would take to get this all done with EC2, and write some scripts to automate it in the future.</p><p>However, since I've finally uncompressed the .osm, I can tell you that as of about January 1st, 2008, the uncompressed OSM size is 67GB.  </p></li><li>

        <p>I'm in the process of working on one of my projects, and the requirement came up to download a fairly large file (4GB).  Since I only receive ~20GB/month at my house, I decided to just use my server in the U.S. The next requirement came about needing to compile Mapnik, which I had intended to do on the server at some point anyways, yet I ran into memory constraints.</p><p>Good old distcc comes to the rescue.  I don't need to use distcc that often, yet when I do, it is very handy.  However, I always forget to set g++ to use distcc as well.  So, for when I forget next time...</p><pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">DISTCC_HOSTS='home'

<p>Maybe one of these days I'll write a more in depth tutorial for installing distcc, yet until then, you can <a href="http://wiki.vpslink.com/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Install/Configure_Distcc">peruse the notes</a> I left on my VPS provider's wiki.</p></li><li>
