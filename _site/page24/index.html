<p>I have to admit, I'm pretty lazy.  I don't (ironically) like to type, and I really don't like typing the same command over and over.  I found myself switching between my external monitor and laptop quite frequently, and decided to somewhat automate the task.  Although I know there are other programs out there that allow this, they either had too many features, or crashed.  Xrandr works just fine, but like I said, I'm lazy...</p><p>Enter <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Zenity">Zenity</a>.  Initially I created a PyGTK monitor switcher, yet wanted something even simpler.  If you aren't in the know, Zenity allows you to create super fast, super simple dialogs to regular commands.  After you click "ok", the command is executed, and the dialog disappears.  Perfect for switching displays.</p><p>And here is the simplistic code behind it:</p><pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">

        <p>As you can read, I've been traveling around quite a bit lately.  This means I haven't been checking the comments on my blog, which means quite a bit of spam has been entered.  I am blocking the spam via akismet, however, it is still recorded in the database.  Being somebody who hates cluttered desktops, you can imagine how I feel about having a lot (447) of spam.  Well, since akismet flips the is_public switch True for good comments and False for bad comments, that makes a <b>really</b> easy query in mysql.</p><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">mysql> delete from comments_freecomment where is_public = False
</pre><br />
<p>Of course, make sure you have backed up your database first.</p></li><li>

        <p>I'm in Tibet right now, so will keep this somewhat brief.</p><p>For the next few hours I'll be sitting in this dingy internet cafe in Lhasa updating my blog with my travels.  I happened to look down and on the monitor it says "works with windows vista".  I find this quite humorous, <i>of course</i> it is going to work with vista, it is a normal generic monitor.</p><p>Anyhow, I guess there is a reason for marketing.  Back to writing our travels.</p></li><li>

        <p>Two weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting up with some of the <a href="http://www.openmoko.org">OpenMoko</a> guys.  You've seen me write a little bit about this project, but meeting them and actually getting to play with a device was quite enlightening.</p><p>Most foreigners in Taipei take taxis, but not I.  My girlfriend gave me a rough estimate how to go to FIC headquarters, yet it was -- rough.  I jumped on the right bus, going the right direction, yet didn't really know where to get off.  In my broken Chinese I started talking to a group of high school kids, who somewhat pointed me in the right direction.  At one point we were coming up to a light and a lady just said: "get off, go down that road."  I grabbed my bag and jumped off the bus.  The street signs started to resemble the characters I had written down, but I didn't know which direction to go in.  I asked a travel agency, and they pointed me in the right direction -- and then it started to rain.  I luckily found FIC without getting too wet, and quickly met Sean, the project leader for OpenMoko.</p><p>Sean, myself, and several other OpenMoko developers went out to lunch and talked shop.  Mickey pulled out a Neo, the hardware platform OpenMoko is going to be based off of.  I'll admit, when I saw photos I wasn't really impressed -- but in person, it is pretty sexy.  Not too big, but big enough to be functional.  In one of my previous posts I mentioned learning C++ back in university, and having basically not touched it since.  In a way, I haven't had to, and I've recently found Python, which is just <i>fun</i>.  However, I'm so excited about the OpenMoko, I've picked up the K & R bible to read while we are traveling.  Not the ideal way to learn a language, but the concepts are somewhat a refresher.  I can't wait to play with SIP/IAX on this thing, it will then be my dream phone.</p><p>Well, I have one more post to make to get some thoughts off my chest.  If you want a postcard, send me an email.</p></li></ul>
