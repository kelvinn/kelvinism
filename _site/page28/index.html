        <p>Having been in I.T. for quite a few years, upgrading can sometimes be quite a hassle.  Having switched to Linux for many years, the crazy upgrade madness of windows is gone.  So, how easy is upgrading in Linux?</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gfJ0rsA5-yezsSSBzH5fSQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgdy7UBLsk4QTB1cYb0IXBmWjq5f4F5CcjYlthEQcPG8lPwKy0aYqu5Gsy30wZhOatB_KxYU0RJPubZVjO78EgQcpBmRi0zakN7fHOek4DmgG9bRj1F-FxP4vpWLmEaJvxLYRq6Qel-W2l/s288/Screenshot-feisty.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/husChXOCHJJ3h1FCRePdlA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiT3OQw0WwVxKnf0vp4xuaf2ClyLihyphenhyphenk2GH1Tgm3OunZWyXb_Gydptfm0ID2qBZezLkbELq6IbJgJ_jAc8LKhGJ9aLZf4ktlFS8h_e2gGVldydYnb87WLTNeUWbtc9z5fFcCAmfXQSdPj9b/s288/Screenshot-distupgrade.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><p>Yea, pretty darn easy, I must admit.  And my system certainly isn't normal!  It has been an upgrade from Debian Sarge(ish) -> Ubuntu LTS(ish) -> 6.10 -> 7.04... The only hiccup was at some point when the fonts were reinstalling (I totally ignored the "close all programs" warning:<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ATQPq4IyXPOUsKgykXO3Yg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9PwKUX6cn2rBmo8DMWoDYU_p4GC6SOD9a7CT2Pho-vTKNpPnHaTMicN1BlhQjMN8hgA7cNePA0aYggj_esDIwmbxNINsukdVEZL2nQi9p_ppzIuC4lfGtvX9Sc7kiMqSWguaJcQg6pQkD/s800/Screenshot-gaim.jpg" /></a><br /><br /></li><li>

        I've received this error more than once, so I'm finally writing my notes how I solve it.<br />
<h4>
Error message:</h4>
<br />
W: GPG error: http://security.debian.org stable/updates Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A70DAF536070D3A1<br />
<br />
This really is just your standard don't-have-the-gpg-keys error.  So, get'em -- take the last eight digits from the long NO_PUBKEY string <b>that is displayed on your computer</b>.  If you are using Debian 4.0, the above key is likely correct; if you are using Ubuntu or another version of Debian, it will be wrong.  (The last eight digits are used as an identifier at the keyservers). Then:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 6070D3A1
gpg --export 6070D3A1 | apt-key add -</pre>
<br />
<br />
Repeat if necessary. All done, just do an apt-get update and no more warning!<br />

        <p>As you can see by my previous post, my question to squeeze more req/sec from the server, I decided to try out Gentoo (again, last time was four years ago).  Now, I like Gentoo, there is no doubt about that.  However, I realized things took just <b>too</b> long to get set up.  I guess that is the disadvantage of a source based package management tool.  Back to Debian I go.</p><p>Two hours later everything was up and running -- and I guess I can't complain about a two hour bare-metal restore from one distro to another.  And let me iterate, this isn't just a typical LAMP boxen.  It's got:</p><ul><br /><li>apache/mod_php/ssl with ~10 domains</li><br /><li>apache/mod_python/ssl with ~4 domains</li><br /><li>lighttpd with ~5 domains (static files)</li><br /><li>about 8 gigs of web data/images</li><br /><li>svn repos + web_dav access</li><br /><li>mysql restored</li><br /><li>postfix(chroot)/dovecot/sasl + mysql auth</li><br /><li>home dirs restored</li><br /><li>chrooted users again</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p>I'm sure I missed something on this list, I was typing pretty quick.  Well, that's the update.  I'm gonna go tinker with mod_cache some.</p><br /><br /></li><li>

        <p>I have a love-hate relationship with Linux.  I love it because if there is a problem, I can actually tinker and find the problem and fix it.  But I hate it because I like to tinker.</p><p>Recently I've been doing a fair amount of Django programming -- enjoying every minute of it.  After completing several of my projects I decided to do some benchmarks, and the results are in!  Generally I can server cached/semi-cached pages at about 200req/sec.  200req!  Considering this is 5,000,000 or so requests a day, and a number I am never going to reach, I still began to wonder: why isn't it higher?  I mean, serving a static html page is at like 1000+ req/sec, so why would a cached page be significantly different?  I started exploring and noticed that Apache would spike the CPU.  Ok, time to be thorough, and as I said, I like to tinker.</p><p>I tried lighttpd as a fastcgi to python -- not a significant different, basically the same.  Next I tried several versions of python -- one from 2.4 and one from 2.5, one as a package and one from source -- same results.  High cpu usage.  Thinking it could be something related to my VPS (or some odd limit within Debian) I decided, ok, I'll reinstall.</p><p>I reinstalled and got things working pretty quickly.  The only slight hiccup was postfix/dovecot, cause postfix insists on being in a jail (and my configs are all setup for that).  Also, Chinese support in Apache isn't working.  Regardless, I re-ran the benchmarks and the results were the same -- so, it isn't related to my previous install after all.  Doh.</p><p>I'll evaluate Gentoo as a server setup for a little while, but I'm thinking I'll do a quick reinstall of Debian.</p><br /></li></ul>
