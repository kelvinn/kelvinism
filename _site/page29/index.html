        I have the need to generate an SSL cert (Apache2) about once every 3 months.  And since I'm cheap, I don't ever actually *buy* one, I just self-sign it.  And every time I forget the commands needed.  So, here they are, for my reference only.<br />
<b>1) Generate Private Key</b><br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024</pre>
<br />
<b>2) Generate a CSR</b><br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</pre>
<br />
<b>3) Remove passphrase</b><br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</pre>
<br />
<b>4) Generate Self-Signed Cert</b><br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt</pre>

        <span class="post-meta">Published on May 9, 2007</span>
        I'm writing this just in case somebody runs into this same issue.  I'm about to go live with a website and figured it would be best to have the latest SVN snapshot checked out from Django.  I updated, and noticed that my voting module didn't quite work as expected.  I was getting the following error:<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
'module' object has no attribute 'GenericForeignKey'</pre>
<br />
<br />
I jumped into Trac and noticed that <i>just yesterday</i> some things were rearranged.  In short, if you are using generic relations, you'll need to change two parts of your code.  First, the generic relations field must be imported out of conttenttype.<br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
from django.contrib.contenttypes import generic</pre>
<br />
<br />
And second, you'll need to change the 'location prefix' (for lack of a better description:<br />
<b>From:</b><br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
generic_field = models.GenericRelation(SomeOtherModel)</pre>
<br />
<br />
<b>To:</b><br />
<pre class="brush: python; light: true ">
generic_field = generic.GenericRelation(SomeOtherModel)</pre>
<br />
<br />
All should be find from there on out.  For more information, take a look at <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges"> the reference wiki article</a>.</li><li>

            PNG Transparency and IE

        <img align="right" alt="I Hate IE!" class="blogimages" src="http://media.kelvinism.com/images/freakingannoying.png" /><br />
I've vowed to not use transparent PNGs until almost everybody has switched to IE7, where they are actually supported (despite being supported by every other major browser).  I've done the hacks, and have had good results.  I like using PNGs, I'll admit it.  <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> exports them directly, however one slight problem: transparency still exists.  This isn't really a problem since I'm not layering images, or is it?<br />
My initial assumption is that IE would simple pull the white background and everything would be dandy.  Well, we all know what they say about assumptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few options exist:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><s>Convert them to GIFs</s></li>
<br />
<li><s>Try some sneaky PNG IE hack</s></li>
<br />
<li>Do a rewrite and send all IE6 traffic to download firefox.  Err... <s>Do a rewrite and send all IE6 traffic to download firefox</s></li>
<br />
<li><s>Open each in GIMP and add a white background</s></li>
<br />
<li>Use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> and convert the background to white.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
We have a winner! The problem is, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out a simple convert command to do this.  The quick bash script would suffice:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
#/bin/bash
CONVERT=/usr/bin/convert
for image in *.png; do
 $CONVERT -background white $image $image
 echo "Finished converting: $image"
done</pre>
<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b>This is gonna convert all PNGs.<br />
<br /><br />
So, no the transparent GIFs have a "white" base layer, IE renders them fine, normal browswers render the images fine, and I'm allowed a cup of coffee.  I hope this helps somebody, if so, leave a note!<br />

        <span class="post-meta">Published on Apr 18, 2007</span>
        I really like using PSAD, both on my server and my laptop.  You never know where the mean people are.  I also seem to use syslog-ng quite often, meanwhile PSAD seems oriented to syslog.  This is fine, and I'm pretty sure the install.pl for the source built will configure syslog-ng.conf automatically.  However, I almost always tend to stick with packages if I can -- if they are even remotely close to the current version.<br />
Anyways, if you need to get syslog-ng.conf configured for PSAD, this is what you need to do:<br />
Add this code to the "# pipes" section, maybe stick to keeping it alphabetical.<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
destination psadpipe { pipe("/var/lib/psad/psadfifo"); };</pre>
<br />
<br />
Next, go down a little to the "# filters" section, add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
filter f_kerninfo { facility(kern); };</pre>
<br />
<br />
And finally in the last section, add this:<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; ">
log {
        source(s_all);
        filter(f_kerninfo);
        destination(psadpipe);
};</pre>
<br />
<br />
Restart syslog-ng, and you are good to go. Cheers to Michael Rash at <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/">Cipherdyne</a> for his work on PSAD.</li><li>

            Simple Chrooted SSH
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Mar 29, 2007</span>
        You might be asking: why would you want to chroot ssh? Why use ssh anyways?  Here are the quick answers:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><b>FTP usually sucks</b>.  Unless sent over SSL, all information is sent <i>cleartext</i>.</li>
<br />
<li><b>SSH usually rules</b>. SSH sends all data over an encrypted channel -- the main drawback is: you can often browse around the system, and if permissions aren't set right, read things you shouldn't be able to.</li>
<br />
<li><b>Chroot'd SSH rocks</b>. The solution to both the above problems</li>
</ul>
.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, let me tell a quick story.<br />
When I started uni in 2001 I was a nerd. Still a nerd, I guess.  I was cramped in my apartment on campus with like 5 boxes, most of them crappy p100s running Linux or OpenBSD.  Life was good.<br />
I started a CS degree (shifted into Business with a focus on IT), and we were told to use the school's main servers to compile our programs.  The other interesting thing is that <i>all</i> user accounts were visible when logged in via ssh -- but hey, that is just the nature of Linux.  I knew this, but asked the head I.T. person "why don't you jail the connections?"  He responded quickly telling me to go away.<br />
Well, shortly after making the comment (although solutions existed at the time being), pam-chroot was released.  This is right about the time students figured they could spam everybody in the school, some 25,000 emails, quickly and easily -- 'cause all the accounts were displayed.  Sweet -- now we can chroot individual ssh connections.<br />
This quick demo will be on Debian, we'll create a pretend user named "karl." (I'll assume you've already added the user before beginning these steps).  Also, the jails will be in /var/chroot/{username}<br />
<h4>
First: Install libpam-chroot and makejail</h4>
session required pam_chroot.so<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
kelvin@server ~$ sudo apt-get install libpam-chroot makejail</pre>
<br />
<br />
<h4>
Second: makejail config file</h4>
<br />
<br />
Put the following in /etc/makejail/create-user.py:<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">
#Clean the jail</li></ul>
