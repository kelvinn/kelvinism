Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads "better," hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele.  Sometimes the adaptation doesn't quite work as expected.  This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) -- and just had to snap a few screenshots.  The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and "customized" the advertisement.  Needless to say, I've seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.</p><p>This reminded me just how much crap people know about me; since I'm in a coffeeshop, I don't <i>really</i> care, but still.

        For one of my projects I need to generate thumbnails for a page.  And lots and lots and lots of them.  Even though I can generate them via a python script and a very light "gtk browser", I would prefer to mitigate the server load.  To do this I've decided to tap into the Alexa Thumbnail Service.  They allow two methods: REST and SOAP.  After several hours of testing things out, I've decided to toss in the towel and settle on REST.  If you can spot the error with my SOAP setup, I owe you a beer.<br />
I'm using the ZSI module for python.<br />
<h4>
1. wsdl2py</h4>
<br />
I pull in the needed classes by using wsdl2py.<br />
<pre class="brush: shell; light: true; ">
wsdl2py -b http://ast.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-05-15/AlexaSiteThumbnail.wsdl</pre>
<br />

<h4>
2. Look at the code generated.</h4>

<h4>
3. Write python code to access AST over SOAP.</h4>

        As some of you may know, I have some projects cooked up.  I don't expect to make a million bucks (wish me luck!), but a few extra bills in the pocket wouldn't hurt.  Plus, I'm highly considering further education, which will set me back a few-thirty grand.  That said, one of my projects will rely heavily on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAWS-home-page-Money%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3435361&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon Web Services</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.  Amazon has, for quite some time now, opened up their information via REST and SOAP.  I've been trying (virtually the entire day) to get SOAP to work, but seem to get snagged on a few issues.  Stay tuned.<br />
However, in my quest to read every RTFM I stumbled upon a post regarding Python+REST to access <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D269962011%26no%3D239513011%26me%3DA36L942TSJ2AJA&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Alexa Web Search</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.  After staring at Python code, especially trying to grapple why SOAP isn't working, updating the outdated REST code was a 5 minute hack.  So, if you are interested in using Alexa Web Search with Python via Rest, look below:<br />

        <p>I've been playing around more with <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/">Hamachi</a>, and have decided that it officially rules.  Since I'm a big Linux guy I don't have access to some features, but the program seems to be a gem.  It is brainlessly easy to install (even when doing 20 things at once), and works quite well.  Thanks to Ben and Sean for helping me test it out.</p></li><li>
