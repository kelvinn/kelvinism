            Version 3.0 Part Two

        <p>Well, I'm basically all done upgrading to Version 3.0, I deserve a cake or something.  Here's the 411:</p><p>For the past few years I have been using Mambo, then Joomla, to manage the content on my site.  It worked quite well, and was in PHP, so I could add or remove any code.  Indeed, I've written a decent amount of PHP apps.  In early 2004 I wrote a PHP platform to track adventures people had gone on, and networked people seeking to go on adventures with each other.  I never marketed it, and mainly created it to learn PHP, but it was a CMS (Content Management System), and a little more.  Late in 2004 I wrote another blog-esque platform for my second trip to Europe.  It was pretty cool, I'll admit: Casey and I each had a blog, and people could leave us "dares" and/or messages -- and we could easily update our status.  Overall, it worked great.  You can also see the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section of my site for some of the other things I've done in PHP.</p><p>Fast forward a few years, and here it is in early 2007.  I've never really liked PHP all that much, but I couldn't put my thumb on it.  Deciding to switch to something else, I picked up and read the book, Beginning Python, from Novice to Professional.  If anybody is looking for a well written book, I would highly recommend this one.  Anyways, with my goal to drop PHP in mind, I held the debate of Django and TurboGears.  I went through the demos for each, and felt like I really played around with them.  Ultimately it came down to 1) Django has obvious crazy cool caching, 2) Django has pretty darn good documentation, and a freaking <a href="http://www.djangobook.com">online book</a>, and 3) the "powered by" sites are quite impressive -- both the length of the list and the large amount of traffic some of these sites entertain.</p><p>So I went with Django.  My friend in New Zealand, Ben Ford, has been ragging me for two months to get my ass in gear and learn it, saying I would love it.  And he is right, the framework is simply beautiful.  For the last week I've been reading through the documentation, going through the online book (both are incomplete, in my opinion, but compliment each other nicely).  I think it is important to write your own code instead of just repeating examples, so my goal: transform my blog/site by using just Django.</p><p>So, while some of the kinks still need to be worked out, everything is no transfered over.  I'll mention my experiences shortly, but overall: I'm very impressed.</p></li><li>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>Over the years I have been shrinking the number of computers I own.&nbsp; At one point my dorm was littered with old P100s, running whatever OS I felt like playing with at the time. &nbsp;<br /><br />VMWare comes to help.&nbsp; In this recent oops, an image I made (for Windows XP), was slightly too small.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t feel like reinstalling XP + cruft, so just resized the image.&nbsp; This is the process:<br /><br /><br />1) Make Clone or just backup your VMWare image.<br /><br />2) Note: if your disk is a Dynamic Disk, you won&#39;t be able use GParted.&nbsp; There is a chance you can use Disk Management inside Computer Managemen inside XP.<br /><br />3) Turn off VMWare image.<br /><br />4) Grow the image. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "> vmware-vdiskmanager -x sizeGB yourimagename.vmdk </pre><br /><br /><br />5) Download the <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php">GParted LiveCD</a> <br /><br />5) Change the CD-ROM drive of your&nbsp; VMWare image to boot from the ISO you just downloaded.<br /><br />6) Boot VMWare image.&nbsp; Make sure to press ESC right when it starts.<br /><br />7) Follow the instructions for GParted. I had to select the Xvesa option, then Done.&nbsp; Choose your language and keyboard and resolution.<br /><br />8) GParted will come up.&nbsp; First delete the partition (the empty one!), and make sure it says unallocated.&nbsp; Then go up to Edit and hit Apply.&nbsp; Then select the partition and say Resize.&nbsp; Hit apply again. <br /><br />9) Reboot image.&nbsp; Windows XP will come up, and go through checking the disk.&nbsp; It will reboot again, and you should then be able to log in.<br /></li><li>

        <p>To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):</p><p>I think I&#39;m going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.&nbsp; Time to stop being lazy.&nbsp; Time to stop procrastinating.&nbsp; Time to learn something new.</p><p>Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won&#39;t be based off PHP. </p></li><li>

        <p>As you may know by now, I&#39;m in Taiwan.&nbsp; Live is pretty good here, especially the internet -- I&#39;m sitting on a pretty decent 12M/1M connection.&nbsp; But the company I have my internet through seems pretty laid back about <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/networks.lasso">network usage</a> <br />-- which for me isn&#39;t good.&nbsp; Their entire IP subnet appears banned from IRC, which means I have to be a little sneaky when I want to talk to my I.T. friends in New Zealand.&nbsp; Worse, some websites even banned the entire subnet:  </p><span class="code"> Your access to this site has been denied because of the large amount of abuse produced by the users from your country.

        I love my Snort, I really do.&nbsp; But sometimes, I just don't need all the extra overhead -- sometimes the resources on a server are somewhat, limited.&nbsp; Looking for a solution I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/">PSAD</a> , a way to detect port scans.&nbsp; Since port scans are often one of the first tactics used to find vulnerabilities on a server, it is a pretty good idea to detect them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the attack, I receive a nice little email telling me what is going on.&nbsp; To test it out I first fired up nmap, and received a few emails.&nbsp; Next I fired up nessus with updated plugins -- you can be the judge.&nbsp; I now have 50 emails from myself telling me somebody is doing something naughty:<br />
