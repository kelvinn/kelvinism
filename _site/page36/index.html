            Hunt the Anomaly

        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Sep 1, 2006</span>
        <p>Information is power, or so many of us think.  As an I.T. administrator, no matter what the level, it is of my opinion that knowing what your network is doing is important.  This includes regular operation, what it could do in the event of a disaster, or when it is just slightly not functioning.</p><p>Jeez, I'm personifying a computer network.</p><p>As I wrote in another post, I setup <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/monitoring-traffic-usage/">network monitoring</a> for several nodes.  But, what happens when an anomaly occurs?  This is the story of hunting down a worm/virus, from far, far away.</p><p>While I can't go into too many details, for obvious reasons, I'll try and tell the story as-it-The overall process took for cleaning took several weeks to resolve, although minimizing the effect occurred the second the anomaly was discovered.  The lengthy time to resolve is mainly due to the time to request computers to be patched/updated/scanned (like I said, this anomaly was with a large branch office in another country).</p><p>I've blurred out any relevant information for obvious reasons.</p><p>Almost immediately after setting up monitoring I noticed something strange occurring.  As you can notice from the below graph (from <a href="http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/">nfsen</a>), something is obviously wrong.  If you can't notice it, that big spike, in what we'll call Network Green, should give you a clue.  Now, I can expect a spike during lunch when people watch movies or send their 50mb picture email attachments, but this spike isn't always at noon, and as we'll see, it sure ain't emails.</p><br /><br /><p><b>Find the anomaly:</b></p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cC1U7SU-l0edQ--5UNBdSg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEht1z52ODlLDYwvk3Qs7QjPyqiYJ40MqI3OofGwdIbQN0NV777mdsavvaIws6OhuyygoaMKVfQ3kRqLUzvL8eQm9_cVqzw3AqGL3iG_9RjU2QH7zwZbleEvgna69GNOwET-dpNjkUJZSRM8/s400/wtf_1.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><p>So, let's try to find out what is going on.  Indeed, there are some analyzers of flow traffic that can display the types of traffic, and are useful if the issue isn't apparent, but NFSEN's filtering capabilities haven't failed me yet (although seeing a graph with types of traffic is useful).</p><p>We can now take a look at what is going on.  Let's next just take a look at the statistics offered:</p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RhLbE6lb-P7TDTe4PMQ0pg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAMfNADISoL8MMmd1gkafmD6dVu4fQZHXVUzbLFHAq7W1genNGQ80VzyBMo8yW5fZB1di5O4BKv5PQ2cxaJHr-CjEOzeE8cr7hwIKvz0qk3XTxjWy3w56YlEI6zFKlgoQlFt8n8rknGfYE/s400/wtf_2.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><p>I've left the dates in there for you to see something interesting: Network Green transferred over 15 GIGS of UDP traffic.  If we think back to networking basics, we can remember that UDP is a connectionless protocol. So, what uses UDP?  DNS/TFTP, some streaming media, VoIP, and several types of encryption.  That said, there isn't any legitimate reason for any of the employees to use that much bandwidth, of this type.  Only one thing seemed apparent: somebody was massively downloading from some p2p source, or we had a worm/virus.</p><p>Now that we know it is UDP related, let's find out more. I've filtered by UDP in the graph just so you can see how much traffic that really is.  Let's select the anomaly.  We first select the left side...</p><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/151anHEmB6D6I0GNP1WXJA?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnSY5uFvnRoJF-k1m3esaeLA2yxBflKa_gV7l3vA5Ono-M6j0fO9sD8yeFVWf0eCpkn0373iY38im6ezl_i9mTY6eNzwoX3dT2MKa3ogKq4TvXyhyphenhyphen9ANj2HVbS-HNZgGnX3j4FAhFWxhpa/s400/wtf_3.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><p>Then we select the right side, and we have a pretty green highlighted section.<p><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Aur3YXp5XZzJP1yOaP9w6w?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWf7WYWZ2z4l_cp9Uv3pelrgTiONwncNva6jij5te_u6DuYl8KT9CuoW-YKv1UYWh__hV0vuYQ_txaNXXXKm6BaYQrfBXv-A0_g7Ib0cc8tGNgE8aeyWM_c-UXBx4iWuB2QqUGxoQCfzju/s400/wtf_4.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Now it is time to hunt the person down.  Using NFSEN's built-in filtering capabilities, I was able to find which computer was being naughty.  I first created the filter rule for the appropriate network (IP obscured for confidentiality):</p><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mHOFaXkMUXc7bLcjDAi-Qg?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEict48l3J3IqI3WOw1NBgxzRg0wUukWYNy-tkJRaeRYNJGqlPlKL-DwYDLQx-O6LuptQUO5bFG-9V056KKl-bQzzmLTEg_wTsQVAWZOgW9iX0LlArhkOmAO5tatrxjZG5FbyLaLrju3GR5D/s400/wtf_5.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><p>Then could see the obvious place to look next:</p><br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OvmjUcP50lyFRu1Vn2grIQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWGYjMkv2unx4qO6CM94BQSfRoflsfwIvyCZDbAAs9hx2WFuQKz29PCXN5cygx16i2tdAOYx_h886jXTQhjes7uC0d324rZKnO-WbJsYvfEF6fqBnlXP6yIxKpp8PJnFBg6UQKQX6jgDYQ/s400/wtf_6.png" /></a><br /><div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><p>As is highlighted, you can see that one IP is continually transferring UDP traffic over port 14857.  Well, it certainly isn't DNS or TFTP! (But we knew that when 15+ gigs was transferred:)  When we look at the Top 10 Src IP Addr, ordered by bytes, we can see that one IP transferred a whole lot of traffic.</p><p>What now?  I pulled out the <a href="http://http://insecure.org/nmap/">nmap</a>/<a href="http://www.nessus.org/">nessus</a> combo and tried to see what was running.  Telneting to port 14857 didn't return any form of hello message, and nmap didn't return any known services for whatever was on port 14857.  At this point I sent out the emails/documentation to managers in the remote office requesting for anti-virus to be checked and loaded onto any computers.  Next, I blocked the port, from that computer, from sending outgoing traffic.  Occasionally, as you can see in the graph, another computer or two would show the same symptoms, but within two weeks the oddity had disappeared.  Thanks you NFSEN and Cisco.</p><br /><br /></li><li>

        <h4>
Abstract</h4>
The following is a Quick n' Dirty method at implementing a very simple firewall.<br />
<h4>
Locate IPTables</h4>
Depending on your server, first locate iptables:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "> [root@vps /]# which iptables </pre>
<br />
<br />
<h4>
Create IP Based Accept/Deny</h4>
<br />
<br />
Create a whitelist (ignored by firewall) or blacklist (packet dropped) if you wish:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "> [root@vps /]# vi /usr/local/etc/whitelist.txt </pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
And/Or...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; ">[root@vps /]# vi /usr/local/etc/blacklist.txt </pre>
<br />
<br />
<br />
In each file, add each IP per line, for instance:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: plain; light: true; "> 4.2.2.2 66.35.15.20 </pre>
<br />
<h4>
firewall.sh Script</h4>
<br />
<br />
Then put the following in /etc/init.d/firewall.sh, and edit to fit your needs:<br />
<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush: bash; light: true; "></li><li>

        <p>As you may know, I&#39;ve been taking a few of the MCSE:Security tests when I have time.&nbsp; This afternoon I passed the 70-291, which is claimed to be the hardest of all the tests (and of the one&#39;s I&#39;ve taken so far, I would concur).</p><p>&nbsp;I&#39;m taking my tests at the <a href="http://www.geego.com/">Geego Systems</a>  center.&nbsp; If you are in Taipei for some reason, and needing a place to take some tests, this place is a safe bet.&nbsp; Their staff is pretty darn cool, and they let me drink as much tea as I want.</p><p>&nbsp;Anyways, the test.&nbsp; I can&#39;t talk about any of the questions, &#39;cause I&#39;ve &quot;signed&quot; an NDA, and Microsoft will take away my certification(s).&nbsp; But, I&#39;ll tell you what I did to study.</p><p>I took three approaches, as I do to all the tests.</p><p>1) Get an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMCSA-MCSE-70-291-Exam-Cram%2Fdp%2F0789736187&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Exam Cram2 70-291</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> book, and read it through, cover-to-cover.&nbsp; This, in my opinion, is a great way to get to know the language used, and some of the concepts.&nbsp; Exam Cram 2 books do a pretty good job of cutting out the fluff.</p><p>2) I have a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMastering-Windows-Server-2003-Minasi%2Fdp%2F0782141307&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Mastering Windows Server 2003</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> that I picked up in Hong Kong last year.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t do a good job of cutting out the fluff, which makes it a great resource to flip through.&nbsp; It is seems to have almost every tutorial you could imagine.&nbsp; The one downside though, as there always is one, is that the book is starting to get a little dated.&nbsp; Either way, this has to be one of the most complete books on 2003 I have ever flipped through.</p><p>3) It is all fine and dandy to read, but it is my belief that everything you read, you should do.&nbsp; My little lab (see end of post for my cool diagram) seems to suite me quite well.&nbsp; If you have read this far, and want some things to do in your test lab, this is what I would recommend:</p><ul><li>DNS - Know how to add CNAME&#39;s, A records and play with MX records.&nbsp; Know how to prioritize mail servers.&nbsp; Know how to create aliases.</li><li>WSUS - Sadly, many of the books I&#39;ve seen (or the two listed above), don&#39;t talk about WSUS.&nbsp; I believe Microsoft just made the change on their tests, but it is on there.&nbsp; And they hit this topic pretty hard, so be prepared.</li><li>Security Templates&nbsp; - Creating baselines and doing audits</li><li>Network Security - Configuring firewalls, configure VPN between two networks (RRAS) </li><li>DHCP - Creating scopes, relay agents and reserving client addresses</li><li>TCP/IP -This test has a pretty big backbone of TCP/IP.&nbsp; Know how to subnet, and general networking terms/methods.&nbsp; Picking up a book on the Network+ certification, such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNetwork%252B-Exam-Cram-N10-003-2nd%2Fdp%2F0789732548&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Exam Cram2 Network+</a><img style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> book (which I read to refresh myself, and pass the Network+ test), could be useful.</li></ul><p>Luckily I was able to get a few years of some real life hands-on experience with installing, implementing and managing AD through a previous I.T. position.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice always helps though.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>&nbsp; <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oEH0-D6u_5NS1GNKIWOgzw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRAYID3YQBXBCuCbW2zToLhdeeNfdGsPblTtncJsJYOUWYiL2kWNmCjjN7-XbNxr6IGWk-JJkDeY39TNWjpH3Begkbr0bhO-TWoxz37Lojgwj9nre_4I8hsh9y020Efb5myfI7hL_apz4E/s800/70291.jpg" height="777" width="452" /></a><br /></li><li>
