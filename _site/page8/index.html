            Destroying Hard Drives
          </a>
        </h3>
        <span class="post-meta">Published on Oct 14, 2011</span>
        If you're like me there is a box of hard drives sitting in a dusty corner somewhere. Some are mine, some are others', but they are all in a failed or semi-failed state. So, why have I lugged them around? I've been a bit paranoid about throwing them away. Some of the hard drives are encrypted, others aren't, and the drives from friends certainly aren't. Although the chances of somebody getting the drive from a landfill and restoring it is minimal, I never wanted to take the chance.<br />
So, I kept lugging a bag of drives through each move.<br />
My friend Clinton has recently returned from Europe, and he brought me a gift: a Swiss-made Victorinox, the 'CyberTool'. After playing with it for several minutes I noticed it came with a Torx 8, 10 and 15 bit. This was a reminder that one method of mostly disabling a hard drive is to destroy the platters.<br />
Other methods I have heard are to use a hammer and nails - which I unfortunately don't have in our tiny apartment. Whilst finishing Dexter I started pulling apart the box of hard drives, and it surprisingly didn't take long to disable them.<br />
<b>Step 1:</b> Remove Torx screws<br />

<b>Warning!</b> The CyberTool didn't have a Torx small enough to open the 2.5" hard drives, but I could just use a pair of pliers to lift up the cover and jam a flathead in there. However, and here's the warning, 2.5" platters are sometimes not made of metal. I forgot about this on the third 2.5" hard drive and covered the desk I share with YS with shards of glass.</li><li>

        A short while ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/articles/visualizing-transport/">visualizing transport</a> by using 131500's TDX data, converted to GTFS, and served by GeoServer. Because I've started <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/travelmap/">playing around</a> with Google's Fusion table, I thought it would be interesting to see what all the transit stops in Sydney look like in FT. So, voila!<br />

            Reload a Cisco Router WIthout Worry

        <span class="post-meta">Published on Jun 8, 2011</span>
        Recently I tried editing my Cisco's ACL at home on the train. It went something like this:<br />
<ul>
<li>I logged in</li>
<li>I started updating the ACL</li>
<li>I hit a blackspot in my 3g coverage</li>
<li>My command stops at "router(config)#access-"</li>
<li>I get a call from my partner saying "what did you do to our internet!"</li>
</ul>
Although it is simple enough to just ask her to "flip the switch on the black box", I still don't like doing it. Plus, if she's not home, I'm stuck. This accident immediately reminded me of one of a trait of the 'reload' command: it can be scheduled.<br />
<br />
In the case of updating a device remotely, it is as easy as:<br />
<br />
<pre code="plain">router# reload in 2
router# conf t
router(config)# [type in desired commands]
router(config)# exit
router# reload cancel
</pre>
<br />
If the commands are entered in fine, then cancel the reload. If there is a problem, then the router will reboot and resort to the startup config.</li><li>

        If you want to use Graphserver to do some analysis with GTFS, you will need to convert GTFS into the database. This is how I did it.<br />
<h4>
Get an appropriate AMI from Amazon's EC2</h4>
I used the following AMI. If you have enough memory, you don't need to do this.<br />

        I've had several conversations with neighbors and co-workers about the "lack" of forward thinking, or at least the lack of forward action.  Of course, I keep in the back of my mind that we aren't "experts", and the more I learn about transport the more I learn how complex it is.  Dr. Sussman's <i>CLIOS</i> process (Complex, Large-<br />Scale, Integrated, Open Systems) appears more and more true the longer I work in and study transport.  There is a plethora of excuses that can be made, but the general conclusion was that the earlier we prepare the better.  I can remember working near Zhongshan 7-8 years ago and driving around on huge roads in the middle of empty fields. There weren't even stoplights at every intersection. It was then that I had an epiphany of how smart the planning was to build the infrastructure <i>before</i> the masses arrived.<br />
<br />
Sydney is estimated to increase by some 1.7 million people by 2036, and I can tell you, from a transportation (private and public) standpoint, that sort of scares me.  When people ask me why transport is so difficult I justify it by with my uneducated guess that the CBD is next to the ocean, so everybody travels in from just 180 degrees instead of 360.  Maybe this is why the NSW government created the "<a href="http://www.metrostrategy.nsw.gov.au/TheStrategy/tabid/38/language/en-US/Default.aspx">City of Cities</a>" strategy.  I realized this within the first few weeks: most people live west but work east.<br />
<br />
Tonight (a Saturday) I was bored, and should have been studying, but wanted to create a few visualizations first.<br />
<br />
The below maps were created using TDX data released from 131500. After converting it to GTFS I imported it into PostGIS using GTFSDB, and then could serve it via GeoServer.  Finally, I could access it via WMS in QGIS.  I added the stops into a map of Sydney and added some boundaries, and added the Growth Zones. The result was a map with every bus/train/ferry stop.  Darker areas have stops that are closer (not necessarily more frequent service).<br />

One of the first things I noticed is that there isn't much physical infrastructure in these areas.  There also aren't many transit stops; I suppose this is why the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_railway_line,_Sydney">South West Rail Link</a> is going to be so important. I don't know all of the political ramifications, but let's hope the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_railways_in_Sydney#North_West_Rail_Link_.28NWRL.29">North West Rail Link</a> is built as well?</li></ul>
