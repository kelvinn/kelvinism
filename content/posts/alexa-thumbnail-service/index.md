Amazon offers some pretty cool services: S3, EC2, Alexa Site Thumbnail, and others. A while back I wanted to use [AST](http://aws.amazon.com/ast/) with [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn't previously exist. I even wrote up a quick [tutorial](http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/).

**Update**: Amazon no longer maintains AST. I've decided to [archive](http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/) a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails. However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including [SnapCasa"](http://snapcasa.com/), and [WebSnapr](http://www.websnapr.com/).
