I have finally decided to do another remodel of this site. I had a few goals before starting:


*   Use one image  
*   Use the YUI-CSS framework
*   Use Django
*   Make it easily extendable
  
So far, I think I've accomplished these goals. The site is easier to read, easy to modify, and has a few new features. More entries to come!
