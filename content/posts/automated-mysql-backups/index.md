Historically I've used the ever-so-popular AutoMySQLBackup script.  While it seems to work just fine, I've decided to give another solution a whirl.  This solution, provided through [Zmanda](http://www.zmanda.com/), seems to be less hackery and more enterprise.  The instructions are very clear, and the backup test went as planned.  Looks  like this is another gem for the toolchest.
