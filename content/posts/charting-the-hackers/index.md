A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot. The majority of attacks are of the form "hello, anybody there?" -- where most people just don't answer. But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer. Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.

A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling. I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving. In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, "hello".

Take a look at the [map and explanation](http://www.kelvinism.com/attackmap/) if that sort of thing is your cup of tea.
