Before we grow any further, a new DNS scheme is in order. Following the pattern of: citycode.domain.com - shouldn't be too hard. A slightly stressful rename of the PDC (just one so far, still small) was in order. After that (and client computers re-associated), the routers were updated, the DNS server updated, and everything worked peachie. Not bad for a weekends worth of work.
