I've had this issue happen to me several times, and I'm finally writing myself a note to fix it in the future. There seems to be an issue with downloading VMWare Workstation (.bundle). I first tried it with Firefox, but it just crapped out at loading it into /tmp. Next, I tried it with Lynx, but alas, it tried to download it as a text file.

Ahah! The quickest solution I could find is to right click the link, save as, and save it as a zip. Rename it to .bundle when you're done.
