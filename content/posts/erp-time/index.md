Currently our ERP setup is a nightmare, both in stability, features and especially administration. A new solution is in order. After collecting goals/requirements we have begun researching, and even started testing some platforms. The "other half" of the IT department and I installed and tested [Compiere](http://www.compiere.com) today on a spare (albeit low performance) rackmount. For those of you (most) who don't know, Compiere is an ERP solution that ties together all the faucets of a company under one hood. We are impressed with Compiere, but installation is a bit on the complicated side.

In the end, we opted for Compiere to be managed and hosted externally, yet we would still administer many aspects (regarding user interaction).
