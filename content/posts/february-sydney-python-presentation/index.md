In February I gave a presentation to about 80 people at the Sydney Python group hosted by Atlassian. Firstly, Atlassian's office was beautiful, feeling a little like Google's Sydney office, but with beer on tap instead of cereal dispensers. Secondly, the talk before me on Cython by [Aaron Defazio](https://plus.google.com/113985890803565448326/posts) was exceptionally interesting, garnering lots of questions from the audience. My presentation, more of a show and tell on piping location data to Google's Latitude through App Engine, was also meant to subtly share my views on the need for innovation in the public sector (all sectors, really).  
  
My slides are below. I used very little text in the slides, but you can probably catch what is going on. The response from the audience was favourable, and I thank [Dylan Jay](https://twitter.com/djay75) for giving me the opportunity to speak.
