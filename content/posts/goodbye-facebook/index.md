I seldom used Facebook, and felt a bit depressed after logging on each time. I don't know if I am alone, but each time still felt a bit like a secret spitting contest. A bit, not a lot, but sort of subconsciously. Oh, he has a nice (sounding) job. -1 I've traveled more than her. +3 The old school cool guy is back living with his parents. +3 She has five kids already - I knew that would happen! -5 Honestly, though, even at an involuntary subconscious level, I don't like spitting contests. I would rather be sharing ideas or creating something. Wish me luck.
