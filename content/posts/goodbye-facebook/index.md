I seldom used Facebook, and felt some kind of negative emotion after logging on each time. I don't know if I am alone in feeling this way, but each time still felt a bit like a secret contest. A bit, not a lot, but sort of subconsciously. Honestly, though, even at an involuntary subconscious level, I don't like this sort of negative feeling. I would rather be sharing ideas or creating something. Wish me luck.

EDIT 12-05-2025: Still off Facebook, and generally all other social media. I try to chase my dopamine through other means.
