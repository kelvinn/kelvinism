I've been playing around more with [Hamachi](http://www.hamachi.cc/), and have decided that it officially rules. Since I'm a big Linux guy I don't have access to some features, but the program seems to be a gem. It is brainlessly easy to install (even when doing 20 things at once), and works quite well. Thanks to Ben and Sean for helping me test it out.
