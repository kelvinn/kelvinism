I like most standards, I can't deny it. One thing that I find too humorous is the amount of sites that are not valid, even sites that claim they are. One tool in my box is [HTML Validator](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/249/), an extensioin for Firefox. A nice little icon appears in the lower right, indicating whether a page is valid, not-so-valid, or really-not-so-valid. Makes it easy to check your own sites, and others.
