Users don't like to remember passwords, heck, I don't like to remember to use passwords. I decided to upgrade all the webapps to authenticate off the domain, welcome a start to SSO. To do this I implemented the [adldap php class](http://adldap.sourceforge.net/) to control authentication to each webapp. Thus, a simple GPO can control who has access to the app or not. A simple solution to a rather simple problem.
