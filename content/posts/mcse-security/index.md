My buddy [Ian](http://www.ianfitzpatrick.com/) and myself have decided to get our MCSEs. However, Ian is a Mac lover, and I can't seem to stay away from Linux (and I'm too cheap right now to buy a MacBook). The irony might be subtle, yet we are still studying and making progress. For the most part, I have decided to take the tests in the following order:

70-290, Security+, 70-270, 70-291, 70-293, 70-294, 70-298, 70-299

  

**Update**: So, now I'm MCSE. I'm still debating whether or not to do the final Security test. I really need to get caught up with Exchange, so I might do the Messaging test at some point, but who knows. At this point I'm calling it good.
