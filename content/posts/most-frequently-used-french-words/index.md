I'm currently studying French, and if you've read any of this site, you'll notice I'm a bit of a techie. Often several of my interests collide, which is what happened today. I was searching for the "most frequent french words," and while I found some lists, nothing was exactly what I wanted.  
My desire was to have a PDF of the top few thousand most used French words. With the English translation next to it. In order. I've found some great resources, which I'll list now  

*   [347 most frequent French words (78% of French conversations)](http://www.fst.ch/FST/download/347_Voc_Courant.pdf)
*   [Wiktionary entry of 1750 most frequently used French words](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_the_1750_most_frequently_used_French_words)

I've also found 100s of sites with 50 words or so - not exactly what I wanted. This spawned a question for me: if I were to search a popular French newspaper website, what words would be the most frequent? I would want to learn those first. A few hours later, and I've compiled that list. I'll write the details of how I did it at the end, but just know I collected over 16,000 unique words, and "read" over 80,000 words from a variety of articles. Below is a PDF of the most popular words, ranked in order, with (maybe incorrect) English translations.  
  
[The 625 Most Unofficially Frequent French Words](https://github.com/kelvinn/the-625-list/blob/master/625-words-fluent-forever.csv)
  
More to come...! I'm going to continue building the database to make sure the ranking is correct, and will make some pretty graphs when I have time. I will also likely modify things to include what type of word it is, and an example in a sentence.
