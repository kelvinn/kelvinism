### OG

It has now been quite some time since I've been making [Blueprint's](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/Step-1-Step-2-Step-3) [Nutty Pudding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eb_41ZpyOQ). For future reference, in case the Blueprint site stops showing recipes, here is the OG:

- 50-100 mL Macadamia Nut Milk
- 3 Tbsp ground macadamia nuts 
- 2 tsp of ground walnuts
- 2 Tbsp chia seeds
- 1 tsp of ground flaxseed (seed that is ground into flour)
- 1/4 brazil nut
- 6 grams of Blueprint cocoa 
- 1 tsp sunflower lecithin
- 1/2 tsp ceylon cinnamon
- 1/2 cup blueberries/raspberries/strawberries (your choice)
- 3 cherries
- 2 oz pomegranate juice

### My Tweaks

Some of these items are a little hard to get in Australia, or have (in my opinion) below average value-to-benefit ratios, and I've decided to swap them out. Instead, this is the recipe I am currently (19-03-2025) using:

- 30g whole macadamia nuts
- 15g whole walnuts
- 2 Tbsp chia seeds
- 1 tsp whole linseed/flaxseed
- 1/4 brazil nut
- 1 Tbsp cacao powder (that's CACAO, not COCOA)
- 1 tsp sunflower or soy lecithin granules
- 1/2 tsp ceylon cinnamon
- 1/2 - 1 cup frozen mixed berries
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 500mg TMG powder
- 1 tsp wheat germ
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp of creatine

Almost all of this is just from Woolies or Coles, but I did buy the TMG from iHerb, the Creatine from Bulk Nutrients, and the cacao powder and ceylon cinnamon from from Amazon. Here is my justification for the adjustments.

1. I've used **whole nuts** instead of ground, as my blender (Vitamix) does a perfectly adequate job of grinding everything up. Anecdotally, I believe that ground nuts spoil more quickly than whole nutes.
2. I've swapped out cocoa powder for **cacao powder**, and it is less processed. It should have higher antioxidants, more nutrients, and fewer additives.
3. I'm experimenting swapping out the sunflower lecithin with **soy lecithin granules**. It is my understanding that there are two reasons for including lecithin in Nutty Pudding: firstly, because it adds choline, and secondly, because it improves the texture. Choline probably isn't a challenge for people consuming a lot of meat or dairy, but consider I tend to avoid both, there is the chance that I need more. Of course, choline combined with meat consumption can be problematic, [apparently](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection/). So, why soy lecithin? Simply because it is easier to get in Australia, cheaper, and has a higher amount of choline.
4. I've taken out the **pomegranate juice** because it is expensive, and the research seemed limited when it came to benefits.
5. I've added **mustard seeds** to boost sulforaphane, which is an antioxidant. Given I cook almost all my vegetables, it is my understanding that this diminishes the sulforaphane content of them. This is from How Not To Age.
6. I've added TMG to help with methylation and reduce homocysteine.
7. **Wheat germ** is for **spermidine**, which is a compound linked to **autophagy**. This is from How Not To Age.
8. **Turmeric** is for it's active component **curcumin**, which is anti-inflammatory. This is from How Not To Age.
9. **Creatine** is to increase ATP production and hopefully allow me to build muscle faster. Apparently there are also some studies indicating it may be helpful to push back Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
10. Removed **Macadamia Nut Milk**, as I just use water. **Macadamia Nut Milk** is expensive in Australia.

### Prep and Storage

I prepare about 15 days worth of dry powders ahead of time. I typically add some water in the blender and put the dry powders in, and then go on a run. My hypothesis here is that this helps with bioavailability, even though the blender chops things up perfectly fine. After my run I dump the frozen mixed berries in, and have a shower. After my shower I finally blend it all up, and enjoy!
