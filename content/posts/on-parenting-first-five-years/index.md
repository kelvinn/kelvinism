When the contractions started, we put in to play our delivery plan. We grabbed our bags, headed out the front door, and walked about 1km to the hospital. This was the start to a relatively unusual life for our daughter.

  

At about three months old we sold our apartment and moved to New Zealand where I could do some consulting; serviced apartment? Yes, please.

  

At about 10 months we swapped roles and packed our single bag - for three of us - and flew to Europe, travelled a while, and then found an apartment in France. I spent the next year as a stay-at-home dad, where I only had three goals:

*   Learn how to cook a bit better
*   Learn how to sharpen knives
*   Hang out with my daughter
*   Optional: learn a little French

With almost no other concerns in life, it let me spend a lot of time with my daughter, and I was fortunate enough to stumble upon some great books on child development and learning. After a year in France we packed our bag and travelled a bit more, visited family in the United States, and then arrived back in Australia. My daughter had visited 22 or 23 countries before she was 2 years old.

  

So, what do I know about parenting? I have no street cred on parenting forums, and I must admit, I don't even know what DS DD DA DH actually means on them. Instead, I will offer this: at five years old, my daughter is pretty chill, pretty easy, and I generally prefer having her around than not. It hasn't been perfect, but here is what worked well and areas that didn't work so well.
