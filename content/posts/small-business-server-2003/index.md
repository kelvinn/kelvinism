Status:  
  
  

I've recently been hired for a company that does consulting for small businesses. Naturally, I haven't had a huge exposure to SBS. My employer asked me to take the SBS MCP Certification, and this afternoon, I passed. The exam was pretty easy -- I think Microsoft basically took the easy questions spread out across the MCSE and dumped them into the SBS exam (some of the questions were very similar). My tips to anybody taking the exam:

*   Really know the benefits and drawbacks of SBS; for instance, it has to be the root of the forest, Premium vs. Standard, it comes with Exchange/SQL/ISA, always use the wizards first...
*   The exam is a showcase for SBS, and then a showcase for 2003.
*   There is usually a logical answer.

  
  

Well, I know that isn't helpful at all. But a start.
