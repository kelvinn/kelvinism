To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):

I think I'm going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.  I've been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.  Time to stop being lazy.  Time to stop procrastinating.  Time to learn something new.

Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won't be based off PHP.
