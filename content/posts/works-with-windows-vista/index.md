I'm in Tibet right now, so will keep this somewhat brief.

For the next few hours I'll be sitting in this dingy internet cafe in Lhasa updating my blog with my travels. I happened to look down and on the monitor it says "works with windows vista". I find this quite humorous, _of course_ it is going to work with vista, it is a normal generic monitor.

Anyhow, I guess there is a reason for marketing. Back to writing our travels.
