    <p>Yesterday I was sort of curious if I could use my 3 Skypephone in a pinch if I got lost, which here in Sydney, happens quite often. Luckily 3&rsquo;s Skypephone has both Bluetooth, and supports j2me apps. Mobile GPS unit, here I come.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3AY6h-qKwGk9NpnB9hrwsw?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjExWMS7zKJdGCG_1MHdpb900yTseLCrbHerf2PlfzwSouqfnmJHr5V1jiIcDcbMrEul2OZUFlCYOQhTgrq_3C-cYDWmxkx-yDOr6NNwokX8P-gUikt3DSjxRi11qJrMuP4_aSRLpjhLPax/s288/DSC03368.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The recipe to get maps on your Skypephone is pretty darn easy. You&rsquo;ll need one dash bluetooth GPS receiver (I have the <a href="http://www.qstarz.com/Products/GPS%20Products/BT-Q1000.html">Qstarz BT-Q1000</a>), <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/index.php">TrekBuddy</a>, a TrekBuddy acceptable map (<a href="http://osm.bandnet.org/browse/?1,1,1,0">easily downloadable</a>), and one dab computer &ndash; but since you&rsquo;re reading this, I figure you&rsquo;ve got that part taken care of.</p>
<p>My process is as follows (on Linux): plug in your Skypephone and select &ldquo;usb storage&rdquo; on your phone. Drag the TrekBuddy.jar file onto your new mounted drive (mine comes up as KINGSTON). Drag a relevent map downloaded from bandnet.org onto your phone as well. Unplug your phone from the USB, and it will scan for new media. Hit Menu -&gt; My Stuff -&gt; Others and scroll down to treckbuddy.jar &ndash; hit Run. Go to your Connectivity settings and turn on bluetooth. Next go to Games and Apps and downloaded apps, start TrekBuddy. Press the key above MENU and select Load Map, and choose the map you uploaded to your phone. Now hit Start. Select the GPS device, and you&rsquo;re in business!</p>
<p>There are more instructions <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=91">here</a> and also <a href="http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/viewtopic.php?t=22">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.com">OSM</a> a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map. At first I wanted to do it on my VPS &ndash; but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn&rsquo;t a way. Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database. Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn&rsquo;t have (although I&rsquo;m writing some code that might make this possible in the future).</p>
<p>The second problem exists with CPU usage. Processes on my VPS don&rsquo;t really utilize the CPU much, which means renicing the process doesn&rsquo;t do a thing. The CPU pegs at 100%, as it is supposed to do, except that the VPS auto-kills processes that stay at 100% for any length of time. Luckily somebody wrote a program called &ldquo;cpulimit&rdquo; (apt-get install cpulimit) that will cap the CPU usage for a process.</p>
<p>The last problem that I thought about is <em>what if</em> I could uncompress the file. Would that use less memory to stick it in the database? I searched and searched but couldn&rsquo;t find an answer to how big the actual .osm file is. I ultimately broke down and decided to spend the 50c it would take to get this all done with EC2, and write some scripts to automate it in the future.</p>
<p>However, since I&rsquo;ve finally uncompressed the .osm, I can tell you that as of about January 1st, 2008, the uncompressed OSM size is 67GB.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m in the process of working on one of my projects, and the requirement came up to download a fairly large file (4GB).

<p>Good old distcc comes to the rescue. I don&rsquo;t need to use distcc that often, yet when I do, it is very handy. However, I always forget to set g++ to use distcc as well. So, for when I forget next time&hellip;</p>

    <p>Status:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that Sydney is one of the most liveable cities in the entire world &ndash; a statement I would generally agree with. However. whoever made this statement obviously didn&rsquo;t drive to work every day. I&rsquo;ve reached the conclusion that one of the biggest (and only) drawbacks to Sydney, is the traffic.</p>
<p>So <em>why</em> is the traffic this bad? I have a few theories. The first theory is that Sydney drivers aren&rsquo;t particularly cordial. I mean, the road could be ending on the merging lane and drivers still won&rsquo;t let you in. I&rsquo;ve literally sat for two blocks in near deadlock traffic with my blinker on, and nobody would let me in. Combine this with the fact that whoever designed Sydney&rsquo;s roads was drunk at the time (roads that suddenly veer off to one side, other roads that go from three lanes to one, roads that steer around a park causing 20 minute delays, or roads always having a bottleneck whilst crossing the rail tracks, etc.,). This plays a role in how everybody typically drives &ndash; they drive <strong>very</strong> close to each other. I don&rsquo;t just mean tailgating, it is something else. I&rsquo;ve been to quite a few cities in the world, and I&rsquo;ve never seen people drive so close to each other.</p>
<p>This close driving has one serious repercussion: there are accidents every morning. When I list to the radio, I continually hear of several major accidents every day. Now, I can&rsquo;t stop people from tailgating, nor can I stop the accidents &ndash; but what I can do is at least try to plot the bottlenecks around the city. I mean, after driving a route several times you&rsquo;ll already know the bottlenecks &ndash; but I think it would be fun to visualize them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already done a fair bit of the research how to technically graph it, although there is still quite a bit more to do. My plan is to use <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href="http://mapnik.org/">Mapnik</a> and of course <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> to glue everything together. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I have a prototype working.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been hired for a company that does consulting for small businesses. Naturally, I haven&rsquo;t had a huge exposure to SBS. My employer asked me to take the SBS MCP Certification, and this afternoon, I passed. The exam was pretty easy &ndash; I think Microsoft basically took the easy questions spread out across the MCSE and dumped them into the SBS exam (some of the questions were very similar). My tips to anybody taking the exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really know the benefits and drawbacks of SBS; for instance, it has to be the root of the forest, Premium vs. Standard, it comes with Exchange/SQL/ISA, always use the wizards first&hellip;</li>
<li>The exam is a showcase for SBS, and then a showcase for 2003.</li>
<li>There is usually a logical answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I know that isn&rsquo;t helpful at all. But a start.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m pretty lazy. I don&rsquo;t (ironically) like to type, and I really don&rsquo;t like typing the same command over and over. I found myself switching between my external monitor and laptop quite frequently, and decided to somewhat automate the task. Although I know there are other programs out there that allow this, they either had too many features, or crashed. Xrandr works just fine, but like I said, I&rsquo;m lazy&hellip;</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Zenity">Zenity</a>. Initially I created a PyGTK monitor switcher, yet wanted something even simpler. If you aren&rsquo;t in the know, Zenity allows you to create super fast, super simple dialogs to regular commands. After you click &ldquo;ok&rdquo;, the command is executed, and the dialog disappears. Perfect for switching displays.</p>
<p>And here is the simplistic code behind it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

ans=$(zenity  --list  --text &#34;How do you want to switch your monitor?&#34; \\
--radiolist  --column &#34;Pick&#34; --column &#34;Output Type&#34; TRUE LCD FALSE VGA \\
FALSE Both);

if \[ &#34;$ans&#34; = &#34;LCD&#34; \]
then
xrandr --output VGA --off
xrandr --output LVDS --auto
elif \[ &#34;$ans&#34; = &#34;VGA&#34; \]
then
xrandr --output LVDS --off
xrandr --output VGA --auto
elif \[ &#34;$ans&#34; = &#34;Both&#34; \]
then
xrandr --output VGA --auto
xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1024x768
fi
</code></pre><p>I send a big cheers and thanks to the Zenity guys, I&rsquo;ll surely use this quick language more frequently.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest things I regret is not utilizing Xen more. I&rsquo;ve finally been admitted to Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 Limited Beta, just two days before I leave, so not enough time to actually do anything fun. However, I think Xen is an ideal infrastructure aid for SMEs in particular. The cost of technology is continuing to decrease, which means bigger servers cost less. This is great for the small/branch office. Let me explain.</p>
<p>One of the themes I noticed while studying and taking the MCSE was that the solution to the majority of the problems was to just buy more servers. Even for simple things like DHCP, buy another server. I&rsquo;ve always operated on a limited budget, and anyways, I don&rsquo;t think money should be wasted on resources when it isn&rsquo;t needed. With a VT chipset, you aren&rsquo;t tied to any OS in particular.</p>
<p>My friend Ian and I were talking and he illustrated a great usage of Xen through his work. What he&rsquo;s ended up doing is installing the Small Business Edition of Server 2003 in a Xen node. The reasoning is that SBE is, apparently extremely difficult to create backups of &ndash; mainly due to odd file locking behavior. I&rsquo;ve had similar thoughts, but mainly taking advantage of Xen&rsquo;s migration feature. The idea of taking a small branch office and putting everything on a Xen server is quite appealing to me, especially considering a second server could be used to create virtual hot spare.</p>
<p>As you can see, I like Xen. I&rsquo;ve found it relatively easy to install, and the fact that it is starting to come bundled with recent distributions is pretty darn, sweet.</p>

    <p>This will be my last post from Taiwan, and I&rsquo;m placing it in my tech section. Shortly I will be flying to Hong Kong, and then traveling into China. I&rsquo;m not bringing my laptop with me. I&rsquo;m always a little wary of using public computers, especially in many of the poorly run internet cafes. Often the logged in user is the administrator, and we all know the computers are obviously crawling with worms and keyloggers. What can I do?</p>
<p>My partner kindly gave me a 128MB flash disk, which is perfect for what I want to do. I&rsquo;ve installed the following applications to run directly from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable">Portable Clamwin</a></strong> - I plan to fire it up and do a memory scan before I start typing any passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/putty_portable">Portable Putty</a></strong> - This is useful for two reasons. Firstly, in case my server (or any server with SSH) needs help, I&rsquo;m on it. Secondly, and more importantly, for security. Putty can easily be used as a SOCKS5 proxy over SSH, so I can tunnel Firefox and IM securely. Password sniffers, be gone! A side benefit is the ability to bypass the &ldquo;Great Firewall&rdquo;, if needed (e.g. the block my Google account).</p>

<p><strong>Firefox</strong> - I tried the Portable Apps package, yet it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed in the &ldquo;known issues&rdquo; that it doesn&rsquo;t work if loaded on a drive with a non-asci path, which this machine (and those in China) usually have. The &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; is to run it in Win98 compat mode, but this didn&rsquo;t work for me. To get around this, I downloaded the normal Firefox, installed it, copied the contents of &ldquo;Mozilla Firefox&rdquo; and dumped it in /Firefox. Then I created a profile directory called /FFProfile, and created a bat file called &ldquo;firefox.bat&rdquo;:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>start \\Firefox\\firefox.exe -profile \\FFProfile
</code></pre><p>Double click the bat file, and you have FF running on your usb drive.<br>
I&rsquo;m in a search for a better keylogger detector, as I don&rsquo;t know how complete ClamAV will be. If you know of one, let me know. Until then, I&rsquo;m going to pretend I have the perfect traveling USB companion.</p>
