<p>Backing up across the states has worked decently well, but due to several changes a more dedicated backup solution is in order. Desiring something quick, simple and inexpensive, research revealed a company that would perfectly fit the requirements. <a href="http://www.ibackup.com">iBackup</a> was a perfect substitute - instead of SSH+rsync to another office, iBackup provides rsync over ssl to their data center. A few simple changes to the cron job, and backup location is thus changed.</p>

    <p>Status:</p>
<p>Time has come to bring another network on the VPN, and perform some more upgrades. The usual by now, I guess.</p>
<p>-Get China on VPN<br>
-Limit access to other locations<br>
-Update all systems<br>
-Perform security audits<br>
-Upgrade wifi<br>
-Setup video conferencing</p>
<p>Ian and I set off for our China office out of Hong Kong, and the next day started working. Total preparation was around a month, maybe a little large, mainly due to red tape. We first acquired assistance of IBM China, who were of a great help aiding us in finding our desired Cisco. One of the most important factors, which we couldn&rsquo;t resolve by purchasing the Cisco in the States, is support/warranty contracts (if the Cisco totally dies, what then). Through our contact we were also able to find some local vendors that would support Wifi and the Cisco, in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>Before leaving I prepared the necessary configurations for the Cisco, or at least a good guide to start from. The technician who came out tried to get things going through the built in GUI, however wasn&rsquo;t have so much luck. I took over using my pre-built configuration and soon (we swapped out the old router with the Cisco during lunch) everything, including overloaded NAT, was working fine. By the time employees came back from lunch, they couldn&rsquo;t notice any difference.</p>
<p>While the Cisco tech (who I believe is a good guy, even though I did the Cisco install) was waiting for some paper work went through and upgraded the way obsolete wifi point from WEP (which wasn&rsquo;t even turned on anyways) to WPA. The reasons for this, especially connected to the VPN, are very obvious. Technically the AP wasn&rsquo;t supposed to support WPA, but he found the correct Chinese firmware and it worked. This is good, as the new AP wouldn&rsquo;t be coming for a little while.</p>
<p>Next on the list was video conferencing. The solution was the path of least resistance: Skype on a laptop. Ian took this one, setup the laptop, and tested conferencing back to the States.</p>
<p>On the agenda for that night was VPN. The problem with bringing the China office on the VPN is one of security. Virus&rsquo; were quite prevalent (e.g. my shared drive on my Linux laptop, to use as a sandbox, had a couple .exe files dropped into it. All with rather odd names&hellip;) &ndash; so we first ran some security audits. Nessus was a great help, as always, and we tracked down over [an UNFATHOMABLE amount of] <em>critical</em> holes. Picking the biggest culprits we started patching computers, removing spyware and running anti-virus. Slowly (a few days) we got the number knocked down significantly.</p>
<p>Lastly I hooked China up to the VPN. In order to do this safely I created some very strict access lists, to only allow outgoing communication over ports 80 and 443 (since that is all they needed at that point). Previously setup we had a webshare website (auth linked to the PDC), so no need to open any other ports.</p>
<p>Overall we completed what we set out to do. We made a few good contacts, achieved our goals, and once again learned more about doing I.T. overseas.</p>

<p>Before we grow any further, a new DNS scheme is in order. Following the pattern of: citycode.domain.com - shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard. A slightly stressful rename of the PDC (just one so far, still small) was in order. After that (and client computers re-associated), the routers were updated, the DNS server updated, and everything worked peachie. Not bad for a weekends worth of work.</p>

<p>All is well for some disasters, but what happens if our entire office burns down? SSH+rsync to the rescue, again.</p>
<p>I first setup the PDC and webapp server to backup to the file server on a regular basis (PDC: incremental every day, full on Saturday). Then the file server takes those backups (including the files stored on the file server) every night and syncs them with another server across the States. In case something drastic happens, these off-site backups should be a savior.</p>

    <p>I have a feeling we will shortly be deploying many Linux servers to perform certain actions. Maybe we will implement Asterisk to be used as a VoIP interchange between locations, maybe the backup servers will be Linux based, maybe the BDCs.</p>
<p>One thing that could speed up implementation at remote sites is to build live cds for certain purposes. For instance, on the file server in PDX to keep updated live cds for certain projects. Like, a BDC live cd or a backup live cd. Already setup with the most current packages (or scripts to fetch+install them). So when we get to the site we just put the CD in, click or type &ldquo;load&rdquo; and poof, the server is installed and configured.</p>

    <p>We don&rsquo;t want to have a billion servers each doing their own task &ndash; so what can we use as a solution? Server virtualization (or semi-virtualization or para-virtualization). This involves cutting down a server into mini servers that each have full customization. Our VPS at hostmysite is like this. So why would you want to do this? A few reasons actually.</p>
<p>-Localize exploits. Let&rsquo;s say DNS gets exploited &ndash; the access gained would only be for DNS, and not for mail and web and everything else.</p>
<p>-Easy &ldquo;upgrades,&rdquo; backups and redundancy. Let&rsquo;s say we start to use MySQL more and more, but the server can&rsquo;t handle it. To upgrade (ignoring replication for this example) we could just turn off the virtual server (in essense lock files), move it to other server, drop it into another server that is setup to do virtualization, and turn it it on. Nearly no downtime, and you know it will work.</p>
<p>Anyhow, worth looking at. Here are some of the most mature linux virtualization packages out there:</p>
<p><a href="http://openvz.org/">http://openvz.org/</a> &ndash; This is the open source version of hostmysites VPS. The main difference is it isn&rsquo;t setup for doing mass hosting (like, 1000 VPSs on a huge mainframe).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openvps.org/">http://www.openvps.org/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://linux-vserver.org/">http://linux-vserver.org/</a> &ndash; Very plain website, but there is news that the authors are pushing for this code to be included in the Linux kernal natively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/</a> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve heard rumors also about this being one of the most advanced.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/">http://www.vmware.com/</a> &ndash; The one and only. This is full virtualization so will contain the most overhead (some of the previous packages have almost no overhead, not even 1%). Oh yea, and this &ldquo;costs&rdquo; money.</p>
