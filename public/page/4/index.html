    <p>I seldom used Facebook, and felt a bit depressed after logging on each time. I don&rsquo;t know if I am alone, but each time still felt a bit like a secret spitting contest. A bit, not a lot, but sort of subconsciously. Oh, he has a nice (sounding) job. -1 I&rsquo;ve traveled more than her. +3 The old school cool guy is back living with his parents. +3 She has five kids already - I knew that would happen! -5 Honestly, though, even at an involuntary subconscious level, I don&rsquo;t like spitting contests. I would rather be sharing ideas or creating something. Wish me luck.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s a little hack I thought I&rsquo;d share. There are maybe other ways to do this, but this way took all of two minutes, which suits me. My daily routine has me taking a train along the Inner West Line (here in Sydney), and I wanted to know in advance if there was any issues with the line. 131500 provides weekely emails about upcoming trackwork, and there&rsquo;s an RSS feed of delays; this is what you&rsquo;d see in many of the Sydney transport-related apps. Another information source is through Twitter. For all of these sources I only really care about the one line I take every day - the quickest answer would seem to be if I could only get updates on Twitter for my line</p>
<p>Luckily this is all quick to do using an only service called <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">ifttt</a>. What I needed to do was create a task searching Twitter for &ldquo;Inner West from:131500trains&rdquo;, and if any new items are located it sends me a message on GTalk. This is one example of what I like about having some mostly open data - I can consume it how I want it. Let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m looking forward to <a href="http://www.govhack.org">GovHack 2012</a></p>
<p>This example could be extended for other purposes, e.g. searching for the word &ldquo;discount&rdquo; on some suppliers Twitter stream.</p>

    <p>Now that our Europe trip has ended, I need to leave a note of things I wish we had done better, both travel-wise, and the stuff we brought along.</p>
<p>I like to travel light, and find it a little comical when I see people struggling with giant 70L backpacks; my partner and I always do carry-on, no matter for a two week trip, or two months. (This means our packs have to weigh less than 7KG). Even in winter it is possible to pack light. The trick seems to be only packing what one will use regularly, with no duplicates, of appropriate size, and hopefully reusable for other purposes. Don&rsquo;t pack anything you would be gutted if it broke.</p>
<p>The lessons below are not just to pack light, but also to reduce stress. Some really only apply to me for next time :) This is not a howto list on packing light for travel, just a few things I need to do better for next time.</p>
<p><strong>Electronics</strong><br>
Only bring electronic devices that can be charged by USB, which leads me to my next point&hellip;</p>
<p>Look on eBay <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=2407773011&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=usb%20travel%20charger&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1359631165&amp;rh=n%3A2335752011%2Cn%3A!2335753011%2Cn%3A2407755011%2Cn%3A2407761011%2Cn%3A2407773011%2Ck%3Ausb%20travel%20charger%2Cp_72%3A2491149011&amp;rnid=2491147011&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">or from Amazon</a><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=ur2&o=1"> for a USB charger that has multiple inputs (make sure it has enough amps if you are charging certain phones). It became a hassle trying to charge four or five devices using just one USB charger. The charger, if going to Europe, should have room to accept a ground, or be able to get around the ground plug used in many places. In other words, get one like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DOKG70/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005DOKG70&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">this one</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B005DOKG70"> not like <a href="http://r.ebay.com/RQ5an7">this one</a> (basically, not like any of the block ones from eBay). Once again, try to get a 4-port one with travel adaptors included.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to consider not bringing my Kindle next time, but instead bring one paperback book. The weight might be about the same. I might not even bring a book - less stuff to break or get wet. I don&rsquo;t do much reading on my travels anyway, instead writing in a journal or finding out what to do next.</p>
<p>Get an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT42UI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002UT42UI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">Eye-Fi</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002UT42UI"> or be able to read a USB stick with my phone. I need to figure out a way to backup photos from my camera to the cloud every night using only my phone (if the hotel has free wi-fi). Sorry if you are the guest next door&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Going Light</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bring jeans, or bring only one nice pair of pants for semi-formal situation. I have to admit, I almost never wore my jeans. After only wearing them once or twice they would get wet, dirty, and/or smelly, so I would be forced to wear my Columbia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AHLYP5I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AHLYP5I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">pseudo-hiking pants</a> over and over<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00AHLYP5I">. The pants are not particularly stylish, especially in European cities, but they are reasonable warm, repel water, dry quickly, and are exceptionally light. After weeks of abuse they didn&rsquo;t smell, or look dirty, somehow. I&rsquo;m a bit of a Columbia fan&hellip;</p>
<p>Try to find one pair of shoes that are ergonomic and athletic enough for walking 20KM/day, or on a trail, but also stylish enough to go into a nice restaurant and not draw too much attention. And dry quickly. I don&rsquo;t really have any suggestions, since I&rsquo;m still looking, but I&rsquo;m certainly never going to put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TDKZEI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001TDKZEI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">my Allen Edmonds shoes</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001TDKZEI"> in a backpack. I am an AE fan, too&hellip;</p>
<p>Bring cotton undershirts instead of normal shirts for winter travel. I never ended up wearing a t-shirt on the outside, so the shirts were basically just used to keep the rest of my clothing clean. I may look into undershits that wick better than cotton.</p>
<p>Replace my money belt with something. It is just uncomfortable. I am trying to find an alternative, maybe something that goes over the shoulder instead. I only need something for my passport.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=gloves%20fingerless%20thinsulate&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agloves%20fingerless%20thinsulate&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">fingerless gloves</a><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=ur2&o=1"> worked really well, because I could still use my mobile phone without taking off my gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Clean and Healthy</strong></p>
<p>Bring two large dry bags for dirty clothing, a dry bag for larger electronics, a dry bag for electronic cords/cables/chargers, and a dry bag for lotions and creams. Or get indestructible bags. The zip-loc bags I brought all had holes within the first few days of travel, spewing my cables everywhere. The corners on any bottle tears straight through them. I have since bought some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=loksak&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1359632248&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Aloksak&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">Loksak bags</a><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=ur2&o=1">, and a year later they are still holding up.</p>
<p>Bring more vitamins, both Multi and C, especially if in winter. A tube from an energy capsule mix would work well to store them in, or Vitamin C fits well into a Tic-Tac container. Only bring enough pills that you need. For instance, I usually only bring two pills of Gastro-Stop, because that stuff works maybe too well. Also, vitamins were really inexpensive in parts of Europe compared to most places I have lived.</p>
<p>Long Johns next time we travel in winter and it looks to go below 0C. We were OK, but that extra layer would have been nice.</p>
<p>Buy a Mach 3 as soon as possible. I tried shaving in Prague before the opera with a normal three blade razor, and it was horrible. I had to use an entire pack just to see skin, and even then had little patches of hair that I couldn&rsquo;t get. I&rsquo;m never making that mistake again. Alternatively, I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a portable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ANH1S0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ANH1S0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20">Sanyo electric razor</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001ANH1S0"> that I saw my dad use when we were in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve lost tiny parts and had to spend time trying to find them. I realized after removing the back of my monitor that I&rsquo;m starting to learn from those mistakes; instead of just sticking the screws in a box with other screws, and then having to dig them out, I taped them to the back of the monitor.</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re like me there is a box of hard drives sitting in a dusty corner somewhere. Some are mine, some are others&rsquo;, but they are all in a failed or semi-failed state. So, why have I lugged them around? I&rsquo;ve been a bit paranoid about throwing them away. Some of the hard drives are encrypted, others aren&rsquo;t, and the drives from friends certainly aren&rsquo;t. Although the chances of somebody getting the drive from a landfill and restoring it is minimal, I never wanted to take the chance.<br>
So, I kept lugging a bag of drives through each move.<br>
My friend Clinton has recently returned from Europe, and he brought me a gift: a Swiss-made Victorinox, the &lsquo;CyberTool&rsquo;. After playing with it for several minutes I noticed it came with a Torx 8, 10 and 15 bit. This was a reminder that one method of mostly disabling a hard drive is to destroy the platters.<br>
Other methods I have heard are to use a hammer and nails - which I unfortunately don&rsquo;t have in our tiny apartment. Whilst finishing Dexter I started pulling apart the box of hard drives, and it surprisingly didn&rsquo;t take long to disable them.<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove Torx screws</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O-GmE3eHG9U-OXc9ofhHUQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhokbuYUa7JT8XbrfA5vuGKjO6pQYrgLdiawZ5Eh5OyfQRjmQhpmUIi3_tDHxOrddforwq3gUXMqlDRu0SXknw6N5YlcPZLV-OIhLwihNfLY9Ycfr1VVUeVR0NW-TwW529hECpY22S7aF1/s400/IMG_20111014_185852.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Hint: Don&rsquo;t forget the screw covered under the paper.</em><br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Use a flathead and pop off the cover</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UCY5r3qEBeaG-mcWOmIYnQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZ4_UT3RI6qGVg9m9FVYwY8dB3fo1qkzb1J1Qg5KYQF-iRms69p7VGFveWqiPIfQUcE3xqFVFTmf6xyDKpPZll34hp3OqdIkGd-5gZZxktCQUqm9YyhIgCa0uIUcTO8BUt8YRaUYiQEzmg/s400/IMG_20111014_185947.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stare at the shiny platters</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cab-oE-cD1Hmeel3o90pfA?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghjNb9VTfqmTLc84ZVOCFmv5qXFvAk6cz6Ei5htC4mLy5OCS20DWYBpg60YjXYbBg5NJSysM6W2OxwV7t3KoPw8nlEYphCNSCNrkC2DaeCeTWvhYRPG2rl574JO7edsvrdFSTcm9TDjtae/s400/IMG_20111014_190003.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Scratch platters with flathead, and bend platters if possible</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tlrCm21ZQ1Mi26iXw6Gztw?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibfpUo1aD4D_lhwKNJ6qNE3GXnpINN_YE7OY64sY22gSXvJavK_Nw6ZUOh_vpwKBEosV-S7BQw0lwckvQ5ziDnN2dXeE7_yuwYEUpu3PJYPiJYXrGHl2Y1tPozvjVc7_3h_3VmyuMeQU8H/s400/IMG_20111014_190303.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Dispose of bits and pieces</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gObs85TTYvn_1ys6X3Ov4Q?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXzJNr7AWUFmKANBfziWE9tnQjF9jJIJWLthyphenhyphenY_vMAnQ5bz647GTjtW4p7yMGMw1hZvknO9V6pf6QQ-eMUtfILS9qVNcuzTwoqE1XD8wxpYUmyjBt_3vOjqZpcj1KMZ-kf1JGV7QrASHiS/s400/IMG_20111014_192607.jpg"></a></p>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> The CyberTool didn&rsquo;t have a Torx small enough to open the 2.5&quot; hard drives, but I could just use a pair of pliers to lift up the cover and jam a flathead in there. However, and here&rsquo;s the warning, 2.5&quot; platters are sometimes not made of metal. I forgot about this on the third 2.5&quot; hard drive and covered the desk I share with YS with shards of glass.</p>

    <p>A short while ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/articles/visualizing-transport/">visualizing transport</a> by using 131500&rsquo;s TDX data, converted to GTFS, and served by GeoServer. Because I&rsquo;ve started <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/travelmap/">playing around</a> with Google&rsquo;s Fusion table, I thought it would be interesting to see what all the transit stops in Sydney look like in FT. So, voila!</p>

    <p>Recently I tried editing my Cisco&rsquo;s ACL at home on the train. It went something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I logged in</li>
<li>I started updating the ACL</li>
<li>I hit a blackspot in my 3g coverage</li>
<li>My command stops at &ldquo;router(config)#access-&rdquo;</li>
<li>I get a call from my partner saying &ldquo;what did you do to our internet!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it is simple enough to just ask her to &ldquo;flip the switch on the black box&rdquo;, I still don&rsquo;t like doing it. Plus, if she&rsquo;s not home, I&rsquo;m stuck. This accident immediately reminded me of one of a trait of the &lsquo;reload&rsquo; command: it can be scheduled.</p>
<p>In the case of updating a device remotely, it is as easy as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>router# reload in 2
router# conf t
router(config)# \[type in desired commands\]
router(config)# exit
router# reload cancel
</code></pre><p>If the commands are entered in fine, then cancel the reload. If there is a problem, then the router will reboot and resort to the startup config.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve had several conversations with neighbors and co-workers about the &ldquo;lack&rdquo; of forward thinking, or at least the lack of forward action. Of course, I keep in the back of my mind that we aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, and the more I learn about transport the more I learn how complex it is. Dr. Sussman&rsquo;s <em>CLIOS</em> process (Complex, Large-<br>
Scale, Integrated, Open Systems) appears more and more true the longer I work in and study transport. There is a plethora of excuses that can be made, but the general conclusion was that the earlier we prepare the better. I can remember working near Zhongshan 7-8 years ago and driving around on huge roads in the middle of empty fields. There weren&rsquo;t even stoplights at every intersection. It was then that I had an epiphany of how smart the planning was to build the infrastructure <em>before</em> the masses arrived.</p>
<p>Sydney is estimated to increase by some 1.7 million people by 2036, and I can tell you, from a transportation (private and public) standpoint, that sort of scares me. When people ask me why transport is so difficult I justify it by with my uneducated guess that the CBD is next to the ocean, so everybody travels in from just 180 degrees instead of 360. Maybe this is why the NSW government created the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.metrostrategy.nsw.gov.au/TheStrategy/tabid/38/language/en-US/Default.aspx">City of Cities</a>&rdquo; strategy. I realized this within the first few weeks: most people live west but work east.</p>
<p>Tonight (a Saturday) I was bored, and should have been studying, but wanted to create a few visualizations first.</p>
<p>The below maps were created using TDX data released from 131500. After converting it to GTFS I imported it into PostGIS using GTFSDB, and then could serve it via GeoServer. Finally, I could access it via WMS in QGIS. I added the stops into a map of Sydney and added some boundaries, and added the Growth Zones. The result was a map with every bus/train/ferry stop. Darker areas have stops that are closer (not necessarily more frequent service).</p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed is that there isn&rsquo;t much physical infrastructure in these areas. There also aren&rsquo;t many transit stops; I suppose this is why the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_railway_line,_Sydney">South West Rail Link</a> is going to be so important. I don&rsquo;t know all of the political ramifications, but let&rsquo;s hope the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_railways_in_Sydney#North_West_Rail_Link_.28NWRL.29">North West Rail Link</a> is built as well?</p>
