    <p>I&rsquo;m writing this just in case somebody runs into this same issue. I&rsquo;m about to go live with a website and figured it would be best to have the latest SVN snapshot checked out from Django. I updated, and noticed that my voting module didn&rsquo;t quite work as expected. I was getting the following error:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#39;module&#39; object has no attribute &#39;GenericForeignKey&#39;

    <p><img alt="I Hate IE!" loading="lazy" src="http://media.kelvinism.com/images/freakingannoying.png"><br>
I&rsquo;ve vowed to not use transparent PNGs until almost everybody has switched to IE7, where they are actually supported (despite being supported by every other major browser). I&rsquo;ve done the hacks, and have had good results. I like using PNGs, I&rsquo;ll admit it. <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> exports them directly, however one slight problem: transparency still exists. This isn&rsquo;t really a problem since I&rsquo;m not layering images, or is it?<br>
My initial assumption is that IE would simple pull the white background and everything would be dandy. Well, we all know what they say about assumptions.</p>
<p>A few options exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convert them to GIFs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try some sneaky PNG IE hack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a rewrite and send all IE6 traffic to download firefox. Err&hellip; Do a rewrite and send all IE6 traffic to download firefox</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open each in GIMP and add a white background</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> and convert the background to white.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a winner! The problem is, for the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a simple convert command to do this. The quick bash script would suffice:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#/bin/bash
CONVERT=/usr/bin/convert
for image in \*.png; do
 $CONVERT -background white $image $image
 echo &#34;Finished converting: $image&#34;
done
</code></pre><p>**Note:**This is gonna convert all PNGs.</p>
<p>So, no the transparent GIFs have a &ldquo;white&rdquo; base layer, IE renders them fine, normal browswers render the images fine, and I&rsquo;m allowed a cup of coffee. I hope this helps somebody, if so, leave a note!</p>

    <p>I really like using PSAD, both on my server and my laptop. You never know where the mean people are. I also seem to use syslog-ng quite often, meanwhile PSAD seems oriented to syslog. This is fine, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure the install.pl for the source built will configure syslog-ng.conf automatically. However, I almost always tend to stick with packages if I can &ndash; if they are even remotely close to the current version.<br>
Anyways, if you need to get syslog-ng.conf configured for PSAD, this is what you need to do:<br>
Add this code to the &ldquo;# pipes&rdquo; section, maybe stick to keeping it alphabetical.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>destination psadpipe { pipe(&#34;/var/lib/psad/psadfifo&#34;); };
</code></pre><p>Next, go down a little to the &ldquo;# filters&rdquo; section, add this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>filter f\_kerninfo { facility(kern); };
</code></pre><p>And finally in the last section, add this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>log {
        source(s\_all);
        filter(f\_kerninfo);
        destination(psadpipe);
};
</code></pre><p>Restart syslog-ng, and you are good to go. Cheers to Michael Rash at <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/">Cipherdyne</a> for his work on PSAD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>You might be asking: why would you want to chroot ssh? Why use ssh anyways? Here are the quick answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FTP usually sucks</strong>. Unless sent over SSL, all information is sent <em>cleartext</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSH usually rules</strong>. SSH sends all data over an encrypted channel &ndash; the main drawback is: you can often browse around the system, and if permissions aren&rsquo;t set right, read things you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chroot&rsquo;d SSH rocks</strong>. The solution to both the above problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>So, let me tell a quick story.<br>
When I started uni in 2001 I was a nerd. Still a nerd, I guess. I was cramped in my apartment on campus with like 5 boxes, most of them crappy p100s running Linux or OpenBSD. Life was good.<br>
I started a CS degree (shifted into Business with a focus on IT), and we were told to use the school&rsquo;s main servers to compile our programs. The other interesting thing is that <em>all</em> user accounts were visible when logged in via ssh &ndash; but hey, that is just the nature of Linux. I knew this, but asked the head I.T. person &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you jail the connections?&rdquo; He responded quickly telling me to go away.<br>
Well, shortly after making the comment (although solutions existed at the time being), pam-chroot was released. This is right about the time students figured they could spam everybody in the school, some 25,000 emails, quickly and easily &ndash; &lsquo;cause all the accounts were displayed. Sweet &ndash; now we can chroot individual ssh connections.<br>
This quick demo will be on Debian, we&rsquo;ll create a pretend user named &ldquo;karl.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll assume you&rsquo;ve already added the user before beginning these steps). Also, the jails will be in /var/chroot/{username}</p>
<h4 id="first-install-libpam-chroot-and-makejail">First: Install libpam-chroot and makejail</h4>
<p>session required pam_chroot.so</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>kelvin@server ~$ sudo apt-get install libpam-chroot makejail
</code></pre><h4 id="second-makejail-config-file">Second: makejail config file</h4>
<p>Put the following in /etc/makejail/create-user.py:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#Clean the jail

cleanJailFirst=1


preserve=\[&#34;/html&#34;, &#34;/home&#34;\]


chroot=&#34;/var/chroot/karl&#34;


users=\[&#34;root&#34;,&#34;karl&#34;\]

groups=\[&#34;root&#34;,&#34;karl&#34;\]


packages=\[&#34;coreutils&#34;\]
</code></pre><p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you need to use SFTP also, try this config:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cleanJailFirst=1

preserve=\[&#34;/html&#34;, &#34;/home&#34;\]

chroot=&#34;/home/vhosts/karl&#34;

forceCopy=\[&#34;/usr/bin/scp&#34;, &#34;/usr/lib/sftp-server&#34;, /

 &#34;/usr/bin/find&#34;, &#34;/dev/null&#34;, &#34;/dev/zero&#34;\]

users=\[&#34;root&#34;,&#34;karl&#34;\]

groups=\[&#34;root&#34;,&#34;karl&#34;\]

packages=\[&#34;coreutils&#34;\]
</code></pre><p>As you&rsquo;ll see, there is a &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; directive. This is so that when you &ldquo;clean&rdquo; the jail (if you need to refresh the files, for instance), you won&rsquo;t wipe out anything important. I created an /html so that the user can upload their web docs to that file.</p>
<h4 id="third-configure-libpam_chroot">Third: configure libpam_chroot</h4>
<p>Add the following to /etc/pam.d/ssh:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\# Set up chrootd ssh

session required pam\_chroot.so
</code></pre><h4 id="forth-allow-the-actual-user-to-be-chrootd">Forth: allow the actual user to be chrootd</h4>
<p>Edit /etc/security/chroot.conf and add the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>karl /var/chroot/karl
</code></pre><h4 id="fifth-createchown-the-chrootd-dir">Fifth: create/chown the chroot&rsquo;d dir</h4>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>kelvin@server ~$ sudo mkdir -p /var/chroot/karl/home

kelvin@server ~$ sudo chown /var/chroot/karl/home
</code></pre><p>Now you should be able to log in, via the new username karl.</p>

    <p>For one of my <a href="http://www.brokebutnot.com/">webapp projects</a> I&rsquo;m needing to layer two images. This isn&rsquo;t a problem on my laptop &ndash; I just fire up GIMP, do some copy &rsquo;n pasting, and I&rsquo;m done.

The great <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> toolkit comes to the rescue. This is highly documented elsewhere, so I&rsquo;m going to be brief.</p>

<p>I first tried to use the following technique:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>convert bg.jpg -gravity center world.png -composite test.png

<pre tabindex="0"><code>real    0m7.405s
user    0m7.064s
sys     0m0.112s
</code></pre><p>Next, I tried to just use composite.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>composite -gravity center world.png bg.png output.png
</code></pre><p>Same results, although the resource usage was just a tad lower. So, what was I doing wrong? I explored a little and realized I was slightly being a muppet. I was using a bng background that was 1.2 megs large (long story). I further changed the compose type to &ldquo;atop,&rdquo; as that is what appeared to have the lowest resource usage. I modified things appropriately:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> composite -compose atop -gravity center world.png bg.jpg output.jpg

<p>I have the pleasure of owning an old T23 laptop. To show you how old this puppy is, the current T series is at <em>T60</em>, and those have been out for over a year. This laptop was made in 2012, and I picked it up somewhat discounted late in 2003. It is now March 2007, and this puppy is still rock solid.</p>
<p>You heard me, it is almost six years old and still working fine &ndash; that is testimony to how well this laptop was built. There are several small cracks around the case, but nothing you would notice by just walking by. This laptop has been to more countries than many people.</p>
<p>I had the first problem this weekend, and it isn&rsquo;t even related to the laptop. The hard drive, a 30G I put in at some point, started to crap out on me. Bad sectors were everywhere, so some of the programs were slightly unhappy (e.g. I couldn&rsquo;t boot into X).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy a new laptop soon, I promise, about the time my <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/mba-funding/">MBA goals</a> are reached. Until then, I&rsquo;ll continue to be frugal, and deal with the bad sectors. Being a good IT nerd, everything is backed up to an external hard drive (and most stuff backed up remotely).</p>
<p>Luckily I&rsquo;m using Linux &ndash; so was able to runs fsck/smartmontools a few times in recovery mode, make the bad blocks happy, and continue as &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Phew, disaster averted.</p>

<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m in a coffee shop? GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_IP_database">GeoIP</a> is the concept that allows you to map a user&rsquo;s IP to the country it came from (I hacked up my commenting system just so you can see an example, if you are a visual type of person). Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads &ldquo;better,&rdquo; hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele. Sometimes the adaptation doesn&rsquo;t quite work as expected. This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) &ndash; and just had to snap a few screenshots. The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and &ldquo;customized&rdquo; the advertisement. Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.</p>
<p>This reminded me just how much crap people know about me; since I&rsquo;m in a coffeeshop, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> care, but still. So, why do I hate GeoIP advertising?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It reminds me how much crap people know about me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reminds me that I should be using the Tor network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of displaying contextual ads that I even <em>might be a little</em> inclined to click, it reminds me how much I hate advertising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m in a coffee shop? GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being curious, I decided to see if I could teleport the girls to other parts of the world. Enter <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>, <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> and <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">FoxyProxy</a>. I turned them all on, went back and remembered just how cool these tools really are.</p>

    <p>It should come as a surprise that I enjoy using Linux. For the record, the first time I booted into Linux on my own was 1997, this was just before entering high school. So, while some of my tech friends played with NT, I was rumbling with the Penguin. Starting in 2000 I was using Linux as my main operating system, sometimes supplemented by OS X, and only using Windows when the gaming urge surfaced. In 2004 I mostly dropped playing any games, which resulted in dropping Windows &ndash; and besides for work, I haven&rsquo;t used it since.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;ll admit, there are three things that Linux still lacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplistic video conferencing support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video editing support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaming</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that all of these are <em>supported</em>, but, in my opinion, not particularly well. Well, I don&rsquo;t care about any of these enough to actually need windows, but it would be nice to see them improve.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m set. I&rsquo;m 100% legal (don&rsquo;t steal a single piece of software). And don&rsquo;t have to be too afraid of virus&rsquo;. What prompted me to write this little excerpt? A recent article at the Washington Post scared the beejeepers out of me, and makes me wish even more for Vista to either cure security problems, or everybody move over to Linux. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/13/AR2007031301522.html">article</a> details the aftermath a virus can cause, not on damaging one&rsquo;s computer, but on capturing information. The author further <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/03/tracking_the_password_thieves_1.html">details</a> his experience hunting down the data. This was one of the better articles I&rsquo;ve read, and I thoroughly enjoyed the further details. If you want a little more motivation to move to Linux (or just tighten your machine), then I suggest you take a few moments to read the articles as well.</p>

    <p><em>Back in the day</em> the barrier to entry for the Internet was quite high. The technology used required a steep learning curve, the equipment extremely expensive, and sometimes even hard to acquire. Fast forward to 2007 and things have certainly changed. If you know any tech people you can likely get free hosting for a small website, and even more demanding websites can be hosted <a href="http://www.vpslink.com/vps-hosting/">for not much</a>. The cost of dedicated servers has dropped even more. And the final kicker: web services. I&rsquo;ve started to think of some web services not as a service, but more like outsourcing requirements.</p>
<p>This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>One of the nice things when requirements are outsourced is the fact that risk is mitigated. I&rsquo;ll use <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> as an <a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/onethumb/2006/08/12/amazon-s3-the-holy-grail/">example</a>. In summary, they moved their storage to Amason&rsquo;s S3 network, which is something I will be utilizing as well. Amazon&rsquo;s S3 (and other web services) continue to drive down the barrier of entry &ndash; now you don&rsquo;t even need to purchase hugely expensive servers for the sole purchase of storage! If you don&rsquo;t need to purchase them, you also don&rsquo;t need to manage them. Risk mitigated.</p>
<p>However, continuing the slight allusion from The Other Blog&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://www.theotherblog.com/Articles/2007/03/14/what-are-mashups-for-anyway/">mashups</a>, I see a slight problem with the outsourcing of requirements. While the following thought isn&rsquo;t particularly innovative: mitigating risk and outsourcing requirements creates a dependency on the third-party. This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>But, as is evident by the fact that I&rsquo;ve had stitches nine different times, I&rsquo;m still going to do some <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/mba-funding/">cool mashups</a> anyways, so stay tuned.</p>
