    <p>I&rsquo;ve hit this problem a few times, and figured I&rsquo;d leave a note for myself how to fix it. Ubuntu 8.04 seems to hiccup sometimes (on a VPS) for generating the correct locales. In particular, I get this error, a lot:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
LANGUAGE = (unset),
LC\_ALL = (unset),
LANG = &#34;en\_US.UTF-8&#34;
are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&#34;C&#34;).
</code></pre><p>Normally I just do &lsquo;dpkg-reconfigure locales&rsquo;, but with 8.04, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to do squat. The solution is to edit the <strong>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</strong> file, and insert the correct locales (it will normally not exist, so create it):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\# cat /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
zh\_TW.UTF-8 UTF-8
zh\_TW BIG5
zh\_TW.EUC-TW EUC-TW
en\_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
en\_US ISO-8859-1
en\_US.ISO-8859-15 ISO-8859-15
</code></pre><p>You can then do a &lsquo;dpkg-reconfigure locales&rsquo; and they will be generated correctly. For a list of supported locales, try this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cat /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED | grep US

    <p>After restoring databases from one server to another I sometimes get this error on Ubuntu or Debian:</p>

+-------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre><p>Next, since we already have the prompt open, do this command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mysql&gt; USE mysql;
mysql&gt; UPDATE user SET password=&#39;\*38794E19D534EBA4F0F78903FA00F1DA2989DCA2&#39; where user=&#39;debian-sys-maint&#39;;

    <p>Status:</p>
<p>It is time for a new project. I&rsquo;ve finally decided I want to do some electronics stuff - at least play around in that realm a little. However, I want to &ldquo;get out and about&rdquo; a little as well, so this leads me to my idea: a controllable long-range RC plane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been debating whether to go the embedded Linux route, or the more simple microcontroller route. One of the first things I stumbled upon was <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A44814">ArduPilot</a>, a cheap Arduino-based board allowing for a UAV. However, after looking through the requirements I would have needed to purchase an RF transmitter, and they aren&rsquo;t cheap. This made me rethink the ArduPilot route and to evaluate what I really wanted to do: control the plan. My ultimate goal is to attach a joystick to my computer and be able to control the RC plane. This presents another problem with the ArduPilot, however, as there isn&rsquo;t an extra Rx pin available on the ArduPilot board (or so the forums say), I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to transmit coordinates on the fly.</p>
<p>After much research, I think I&rsquo;ve determined what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;m ultimately going to adopt the best parts of the ArduPilot, and fill in the gaps with my own board. I&rsquo;m going to take an EasyStar, combine it with an Arduino Mini, Xbee, XY Sensor, GPS module, servos, H-bridges and a custom PCB, and hope it works.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned from YS is to stage our the things I buy. For instance, instead of signing up for a year at a local gym, try a month first. This project won&rsquo;t be any different, and while most of the equipment is very reasonably priced, I still want to make sure I enjoy this type of thing. The first stage is going to be to buy the Arduino Mini, breadboard, servos and h-bridge (and a cheap DC motor), and see if I can get it all working. If I can, I&rsquo;ll buy the EasyStar and see if I can control it with a joystick. If still successful, I&rsquo;ll acquire the Xbees and GPS module - and these represent the majority of the cost.</p>
<p>Another element I&rsquo;ve considered is how to visualize the RC plane flying around. I had contemplated looking into using Google Earth, but I&rsquo;d really prefer to use a free variant. I also want to strengthen my Java knowledge, so have opted to use the SDK for WorldWind. I was very excited to see that they also have support for OSM, which is just spectaculous. I plan to have a HUD that on the right displays the plane&rsquo;s location in WorldWind, and on the left display current altitude, tilt and RF strength. Since I&rsquo;ve been flying through a book on Processing, this looks like a perfect real-life opportunity to use it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m likely to start putting my money where my mouth is in the next two weeks.</p>

    <p>Back in 2000 I managed to acquire several retired systems to bring to Uni: this included 4-5 cheap P120 machines. At the time, I thought this was great; I had an OpenBSD box as my gateway, a FreeBSD box, a few Linux boxes, and likely something else that doesn&rsquo;t even exist now. The school has a superfast connection, unlimited bandwidth, and I was curious. Although I didn&rsquo;t really have <em>time</em>, I still managed to install and have all these servers running from my room.</p>
<p>I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2007, and my mindset has changed. In 2007 I didn&rsquo;t want to have 6 servers running at once, I wanted to have one server running 12 servers at once! Thanks to Xen and VMware this was easily obtained. Initially using Xen, and then ESXi, I had the freedom to setup Domains, tear them down, and start over. Eventually, however, I realized I was doing at home what I was being paid to do at work. That doesn&rsquo;t sound like fun. I also realized that, despite picking a motherboard and processor that could shift into low power usage, I was still using more watts than I needed to. I was also spending way too much time mucking around with things - I want to focus on just one or two projects at a time, and I <em>really</em> want to start programming more.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NUJH80rJPtKH0NsD_ZTLxA?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcfWyN502_EgPg12BajqcMJbJhr9iaYe1SWLaZDGUIFaOJmPC7QXngeZtr5qlESw3l2QB7DINsCjjskut4PYYKwkOYz6N68bc3TxILX1cjiReHA5FOiK5yM2B8UTddfoOY4Yk6GxuB738/s400/ebox3300.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Last month I finally finished the ultimate &lsquo;consolidation&rsquo;: I moved everything to a tiny embedded Linux box. While back in the U.S. I contacted <a href="http://www.wdlsystems.com/">WDL Systems</a> and requested for shipping costs on a tiny embedded box. I bought the eBox-3300, with an embedded board from ICOP, and it was promptly shipped out. After returning home to Sydney I migrated all my apps from the various virtual servers to my little box running Debian 5.0: OSSEC, Samba, Lighttpd, Asterisk and flow-tools. The little box is just perfect for what I need - a tiny home server. I still get around 8MB/sec transferring files, which indicates the network is still the bottleneck, and VOIP calls with Asterisk are still clear.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;ve been happy with this little box. My &lsquo;playing time&rsquo; with IT has gone down significantly, my energy usage has gone down, and I now have a server I can take with me wherever I go.</p>

    <p>I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them. I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file. logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log &ndash; e.g. kelvinism_access_log. I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.</p>
<p>Firstly, I had to rename the actual log files. So, to rename kelvinism_access_log to kelvinism_access.log, a one-liner:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>for x in \*\_log; do mv $x \`basename $x \_log\`.log; done;
</code></pre><p>Next, I needed to rename the log location inside each of the Apache config files. While a one-liner might be possible, I used the following tiny script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

    <p>I&rsquo;m not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind. I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS. If I had a million dollars, I&rsquo;d likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to. Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent. I mean, the type of software where you aren&rsquo;t asking &ldquo;I wish this could do this&rdquo; and start asking &ldquo;I wonder what else this can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve played around with most types of virtualization out there (OpenVZ, Xen, V-Server, qemu&hellip;), I&rsquo;ve really found a soft spot for VMWare.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, if I was going to host a heap of Linux web servers I would absolutely use Xen, but for a heterogeneous environment, I haven&rsquo;t used anything as easy as VMWare&rsquo;s products. Not that I judge a product by how easy it is to use, not by a long shot, but ease of use sure makes judging other factors easier.</p>
<p>Regardless, this isn&rsquo;t a post trumpeting VMWare. I just realized tonight that some of the VMs I have running don&rsquo;t need to be except for certain hours of the day, or if condition A is true. The first example is my backup mail server; I really don&rsquo;t need it even powered on unless my main server is down. The second example is my Server 2003 instance, which has VI3 on it; I don&rsquo;t need this running unless I&rsquo;m asleep. One of the most useful resources I&rsquo;ve seen for the vmrun command is over at <a href="http://www.virtuatopia.com/index.php/Controlling_VMware_Virtual_Machines_from_the_Command_Line_with_vmrun">VirtualTopia</a> &ndash; loaded with examples.</p>
<h4 id="turn-off-via-time">Turn off via time</h4>
<p>On my &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; instance, which is always up, I&rsquo;ve decided to install the script that controls my VM. I&rsquo;ve opted to use a soft shutdown.</p>
<p>192.168.0.10 = ESXi box</p>
<p>datastore1 = name of datastore that hosts VMs</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root\_password stop &#34;\[datastore1\] Server 2003 R2/Server 2003 R2.vmx&#34; soft
</code></pre><p>I have that saved in a file called <strong>stop_2003.sh</strong> in /opt/vmware/bin; make sure it isn&rsquo;t world readable. I also have a <strong>start_2003.sh</strong>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root\_password start &#34;\[datastore1\] Server 2003 R2/Server 2003 R2.vmx&#34;
</code></pre><p>Next, edit root&rsquo;s crontab (crontab -e):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 8 \* \* \* /opt/vmware/bin/start\_2003.sh
0 23 \* \* \* /opt/vmware/bin/stop\_2003.sh
</code></pre><p>The conditional task is a tad bit more tricky, but just a tad. Ping won&rsquo;t do, since the mailserver could go down itself, so install nmap. Create a script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/bash

if nmap -p25 -PN -sT -oG - mail.kelvinism.com | grep &#39;Ports:.\*/open/&#39; &gt;/dev/null ; then
echo \`time\` &gt;&gt; mailserver.log
else
/opt/vmware/bin/start\_mail.sh
fi
</code></pre><p>And sticking with our theme, <strong>start_mail.sh</strong>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/sh

vmrun -t esx -h https://192.168.0.10/sdk -u root -p root\_password start &#34;\[datastore1\] Mail Server/Mail Server.vmx&#34;
</code></pre><p>This of course changes the crontab entry to:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 8 \* \* \* /opt/vmware/bin/start\_2003.sh
0 23 \* \* \* /opt/vmware/bin/stop\_2003.sh
\*/5 \* \* \* \* /opt/vmware/bin/detect\_port.sh
</code></pre><p>So, that&rsquo;s it. detect_port.sh is lacking any type of error detection or redundancy - if one packet/scan is dropped, the mail server will turn on. I&rsquo;ll re-work this at some point, but it works for now.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Vmware has also released a decent blog entry about using vmrun: <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vix/2008/12/managing-vm-guests-using-vmrun.html">on their blog</a>.</p>

A while back I wanted to use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ast/">AST</a> with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn&rsquo;t previously exist. I even wrote up a quick <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Amazon no longer maintains AST. I&rsquo;ve decided to <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/">archive</a> a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails. However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including <a href="http://snapcasa.com/">SnapCasa&quot;</a>, and <a href="http://www.websnapr.com/">WebSnapr</a>.</p>

    <p>A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot. The majority of attacks are of the form &ldquo;hello, anybody there?&rdquo; &ndash; where most people just don&rsquo;t answer. But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer. Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.</p>
<p>A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling. I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving. In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, &ldquo;hello&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/attackmap/">map and explanation</a> if that sort of thing is your cup of tea.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been side-tracked on another little project, and keep coming back to NetFlow. For this project I&rsquo;ll need to access NetFlow data with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, but this is a bit tricky. First, I&rsquo;m sort of lazy when it comes to my own project; maybe not lazy, I just like taking the most direct route. The most up-to-date NetFlow collector I noticed was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>, and there is even a switch to export the information into MySQL. Sweet! However, I wanted to insert the flows into MySQL automatically, or at least on a regular basis. I first started writing a python script that would do the job, but after a few minutes noticed flow-capture had a rotate_program switch, and started investigating. Since I somehow couldn&rsquo;t find anywhere instructions how to insert the data automatically, here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/">flow-tools</a>; make sure to configure with &ndash;with-mysql (and you&rsquo;ll have to make sure you have the needed libraries).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new database, I called mine &rsquo;netflow'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a table that can contain all the netflow fields, a sample is below. I added a &ldquo;flow_id&rdquo; field that I used as a primary key, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily need this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
