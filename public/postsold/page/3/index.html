      <p>YS and I were recently interviewed about self-tracking and Quantified Self by one of the major news channels in Australia. I will reflect on the experience after the show has aired, but it was an overall great experience. We have a new respect for filming what may ultimately be just a two minute segment. Depending on how the editing is done it will either provoke the hosts to contemplate the value of a data-centric macroscopic view of the world, or give them lots of fodder.</p>

      <p>One of the things I like Tableau, a piece of software to visualise data, is that it aggregates on dates really well. Below is a spread of beer / wine / coffee over 18 months, but grouped by what hour is fell in. You can see some trends, like I usually consume coffee in the morning, and that I usually drink after 17:00. There are exceptions, of course, like that beer I had at 10AM, and that coffee I had at 1AM.</p>

      <p>There is the possibility I will be giving an interview on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">Quantified Self</a> &ldquo;movement&rdquo;. What follows is a brief summary of QS, the things I track, and some pretty charts.</p>
<p><strong>What is Quantified Self</strong></p>
<p>I suppose it depends on who you talk to. Wikipedia states that it is &ldquo;a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person&rsquo;s daily life in terms of inputs&rdquo;, but I side more on the idea that the movement is &ldquo;a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking.&rdquo; It is at this point that it is probably important to interject that most people are self-trackers: weight, height, reps at the gym, hours worked, and so forth. If you have ever made a goal, you probably tracked how you could reach it. What makes us QS folk a bit different is that we tend to track <em>lots</em> of things, correlate between them, and share our results. So, with this theme, let me share what I track.</p>

      <p>I quite like open data. I like data based on open standards (or mostly open standards) even better. Many transport operators around the world have started releasing their timetable data using (mostly) open standards, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification">GTFS</a>. One of the nice things about using a standard is that clever people have created tools to work with the timetable data, and those tools can now be used to manipulate timetable data from hundreds of agencies. The magnificent OpenTripPlanner is one such tool, and it works well with <a href="http://131500.info/">131500</a>&rsquo;s GTFS data.</p>

      <p>This quick tutorial will detail how to prepair the ABS Mesh Blocks to be used with MapBox&rsquo;s TileMill. Beyond scope is how to install postgresql, postgis and TileMill. There is a lot of documentation how to do these tasks.</p>
<p>First, we create a database to import the <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202011?OpenDocument">shapefile</a> and <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2074.02011?OpenDocument">population data</a> into:</p>
<p>Using &lsquo;psql&rsquo; or &lsquo;SQL Query&rsquo;, create a new database:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>CREATE DATABASE transport WITH TEMPLATE postgis20 OWNER postgres;
# Query returned successfully with no result in 5527 ms.
</code></pre><p>It is necessary to first import the Mesh Block spatial file using something like PostGIS Loader.</p>

Times have changed significantly in the last five years, and thanks a lot to the products offered by <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>. After playing with TileMill, MBTiles, Leaflet and UTFGrids, it is great how many annoyances have been fixed by MapBox. I find it enjoyable making maps now, as I no longer need to worry about patching code just to get it to run, or mucking about with oddities in web browser.</p>

<p>I will try to avoid posting spoilers of the major sites, and instead focus on logistics of doing the trek. First things first: much of this content is from what we learned at a talk given at the <a href="http://www.erraticrock.com/">Erratic Rock</a> hostel, at 3PM the day before entering the park. The single biggest suggestion I would give you is to go to this talk.</p>

Secondly, the talk before me on Cython by <a href="https://plus.google.com/113985890803565448326/posts">Aaron Defazio</a> was exceptionally interesting, garnering lots of questions from the audience.

I used this site as a learning tool for Django, re-wrote it after gaining more knowledge of Django, and then re-wrote it again when Google released App Engine. However, I recently realised that for the last few years I have spent more time writing little features than actually writing.
