    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>A few years ago, probably in late 2022, I was doing some self-reflection and was pondering what the next constraint was for improving my health. Depending on whom you ask, there are generally several areas of focus when it comes to health:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Metabolic health</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>Testing or screenings</li>
<li>Supplementation or pharmacological interventions</li>
</ol>
<p>The conclusion I reached after seeing/eating more of my partner&rsquo;s diet is that nutrition was the next area for me to focus on. My approach has typically been to deep dive on reading books, and since then I&rsquo;ve read the following books related to nutrition and longevity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Longevity Diet</li>
<li>Outlive</li>
<li>How Not To Age</li>
<li>Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</li>
<li>The Art of Lifting</li>
<li>The Science of Lifting</li>
<li>And I&rsquo;m currently reading the Longevity Leap.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to books I also found a few channels on YouTube that I generally thought were evidence based and produced well, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Viva-Longevity">Plant Chompers / Viva Longevity!</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Physionic">Physionic</a> being some of my favourite.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this morning, when I was outside eating breakfast (sunshine exposure!) and I thought it might be worthwhile to do a yearly reflection of each year. Perhaps this is just me being influenced by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/More-Gold-Stars-Regenerating-Ourselves/dp/0989301389">No More Gold Stars</a>!</p>
<p>Without further delay, let&rsquo;s get going on my inaugural State of Health series!</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>My main form of cardio is running, so let&rsquo;s start there. You can clearly see when I went on holiday (December), as it was really challenging to be able to find time / fresh air to run.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBuWLwxHeDom5D46JypAhzFb5_cLVmGMsHnsUy7pKp7aLMxNvMereKRwqtTRl9VRNWNlXg7OfDoYaSBHdjS0uNsMmlt-cuhia4xblvwPnwD9w_Gr_eO32mIrR0ePXp4Hl0NSgWOwCl6hhPRiA7oS8ny-EHpZ35wvglDrL0OXQD4mNyd54xNJWVxvDDAzAB/s1798/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.10.15%E2%80%AFam.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBuWLwxHeDom5D46JypAhzFb5_cLVmGMsHnsUy7pKp7aLMxNvMereKRwqtTRl9VRNWNlXg7OfDoYaSBHdjS0uNsMmlt-cuhia4xblvwPnwD9w_Gr_eO32mIrR0ePXp4Hl0NSgWOwCl6hhPRiA7oS8ny-EHpZ35wvglDrL0OXQD4mNyd54xNJWVxvDDAzAB/w640-h365/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.10.15%E2%80%AFam.png"></a></p>
<p>My total distance for 2024 was 2759km over 417 hours, which is about 8 hours of cardio on average per week. This seems to be under the threshold limit of the &ldquo;cardio <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7431070/">j-curve of CVD</a>&rdquo; that I read about a number of years ago.</p>
<p>I did less hiking in 2024 than in 2023, which I hope to rectify in 2025.</p>
<p>In addition to cardio I&rsquo;ve been trying to increase the amount of time I spend resistance training, so that became more of a focus after both my first DEXA scan as well as reading the Science of Lifting.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhicmKAEovuwBe6ZfHkQV3H2hSqavikRpcNfzyStTCeyiwTXQ384nXiNNcdyZA1ShhoHj-NasqR7IL86dK2O1v2ixPSiC8SIR537tpIwbqgRjOiGWFeU7fv72CSTe3WXx20ube_sc3Khdv6nQsqo3G0iZMqeLN3lv93V4fVM6PQZGj4epYZhiU2ZXVk_vC8/s1790/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.24.37%E2%80%AFam.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhicmKAEovuwBe6ZfHkQV3H2hSqavikRpcNfzyStTCeyiwTXQ384nXiNNcdyZA1ShhoHj-NasqR7IL86dK2O1v2ixPSiC8SIR537tpIwbqgRjOiGWFeU7fv72CSTe3WXx20ube_sc3Khdv6nQsqo3G0iZMqeLN3lv93V4fVM6PQZGj4epYZhiU2ZXVk_vC8/w640-h406/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.24.37%E2%80%AFam.png"></a></p>
<p>I think I will continue with adopting an approach of progressive overload and focussing on total volume, with a mixture of intensities focussing on both hypertrophy and strength.</p>
<h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h3>
<p>My diet continues to be whole foods plant based, but with exceptions when travelling; if needed I&rsquo;ll have some chicken, fish, or eggs.</p>

<p>Nutty Pudding</p>
<p>How do we track how well nutrition is working? For now, let&rsquo;s just look at my weight.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj63SEMgerqdTVGPWZYNvMAvRxoLBaMo4iRU1K1rCdj4l99eRf60u_Ze04vukY6333TBUtR8qwdWaNngS1vDLWwb_sClG-TNek1WFkriKaRpsc90QDJAUkwTpDq4H3WvEzJ0QbKfFrlkidXcRKYF7qBK3qoQMe1wy4CM3qUPp-WYAV9jh553BuclfKhoJmg/s2280/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj63SEMgerqdTVGPWZYNvMAvRxoLBaMo4iRU1K1rCdj4l99eRf60u_Ze04vukY6333TBUtR8qwdWaNngS1vDLWwb_sClG-TNek1WFkriKaRpsc90QDJAUkwTpDq4H3WvEzJ0QbKfFrlkidXcRKYF7qBK3qoQMe1wy4CM3qUPp-WYAV9jh553BuclfKhoJmg/w640-h302/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%208.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png"></a></p>
<p>I was previously using a Withings scale, and apparently it didn&rsquo;t sync correctly, but the new Garmin one does. From what I can tell my weight has been fairly consistent for the H2 of the year, but with a drop in December due to travel. My typical meal looks like this:</p>
<p>Breakfast (about 6am): thins with ABC nut butter and banana and cinnamon</p>
<p>Snack (about 8am): Nutty Pudding, but with mustard seeds and turmeric.</p>
<p>Lunch: Super Veggie, w/Kimchee</p>
<p>Dinner: Something from <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die-cookbook/">The How Not To Die Cookbook</a></p>
<p>The DEXA scan I did in the beginning of 2024 had me at <strong>18.5%</strong> body fat, so it will be interesting to see what I&rsquo;m at in my next scan. </p>
<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Sleep became much more of a focus in 2024 after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760?crid=3GFYDA14PZV7N&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HqZgX72gI9PBGMtU0GUwo2axDi0vyYeL6Yd7dhsk4E2pPhgyHrRI31dO90lEk4F95_tc96Tkk79xc-IwOtptJXOU7QiqzGM2lhmaEuX3lkl-dXe3_NDe_FZhx2oH-HSKvEzbR5K3DSj1uXyYdq7THueUsEssq8hmWSdOrOVs0o-AazMhKBfStt6fqO1U7rYTijEKxnpK_B-ak9M6kYco0nvbCSAG9rboEB_HOLuSRG0JUdQ19UgOBf80mGBTm5SLgnEXsOP-PjTlWsPKatSygcha9Nz0MS7hxpjsfjqdBi3uEZIayaX5wyWSbVqGHlPw2lWZkIEkxp-I2lrpv1VVmkW0qGNUZsC2XikSYdaRzAbWEhRBH37vVur12MwGTkKSue-h0GgWJF1g45onQcHitnGzwyythj4YJCUueYvanZBZOY4QblR5epnbxkaPZwuC.1guDuFcWGuR3dOAPpkdkJihh6IdvmDFsKLz2GRZlOvs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=why+we+sleep&amp;qid=1738274327&amp;sprefix=why+we+sleep%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-1">Why We Sleep</a> in Sep 2023.</p>
<p>However, my sleep in in 2024 was less consistent than in 2023, unfortunately. My average &ldquo;<a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/health/garmin-sleep-score-and-sleep-insights/">Sleep Score</a>&rdquo; was an 82 in both 2023 and 2024, yet 2023 saw a Standard Deviation of 3.0 while 2024 saw 5.2. This is quite ironic, as I was much more aware of my sleep in 2024, but I believe due almost entirely due to work related stress.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwX5byKLg6GY5dbv5sDm13qOeDF1DveRIHRthBy6P3nBOV6sJw0PTCEyl6yvI2laBR63vk7dB1Vra6TYN6nmsSLtwG1w6qun3f5kcK2Xg5jblPiwWAN8BC_vMYzwUZvTRp81SdUVaAnCJ60qbzzKGDjLdEvqz87pfvF8aBVJRAoFV-CjoPOjliBOUc1WpF/s2034/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%209.03.55%E2%80%AFam.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwX5byKLg6GY5dbv5sDm13qOeDF1DveRIHRthBy6P3nBOV6sJw0PTCEyl6yvI2laBR63vk7dB1Vra6TYN6nmsSLtwG1w6qun3f5kcK2Xg5jblPiwWAN8BC_vMYzwUZvTRp81SdUVaAnCJ60qbzzKGDjLdEvqz87pfvF8aBVJRAoFV-CjoPOjliBOUc1WpF/w640-h304/Screenshot%202025-01-31%20at%209.03.55%E2%80%AFam.png"></a></p>
<p>In 2023 my average duration was 7hr 33m, and in 2024 it was 7hr 28m.  However, my average bed time decreased from 10:25PM to 10:10PM.</p>
<p>I continue to wear ear plugs when I sleep, and try to sleep in a separate bed from anyone whenever possible. For 2025 this will be a focus, and it would be ideal if I could routinely get in the 90+ sleep score space.</p>
<h3 id="supplementation">Supplementation</h3>
<p>While many people are comfortable taking 100s of supplements, I have been trying to stick to what is on the ITP website for <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp/supported-interventions">supported interventions</a>. For most of 2024 I took the following supplements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collagen 15g </li>
<li>Trimethylglycine (TMG) 500mg</li>
<li>Niacin 50mg</li>
<li>Vitamin K2 MK-7 90µg</li>
<li>Zinc 8.25mg</li>
<li>Creatine 5g</li>
<li>Omega 3</li>
</ul>
<p>I also tried taking Boron to lower my SHBP levels, but I believe it negatively impacts my sleep.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Here is a snapshot of my biomarkers.</p>

<p>I also track my biomarkers in <a href="https://carrotcare.health/">Carrot Care</a>, and the main areas of focus for 2025 will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to lower my LDL</li>
<li>Keeping my ApoB low</li>
<li>Re-testing IGF-1</li>
<li>Re-testing my progesterone levels (potentially low due to stress at time of previous test)</li>
<li>Exploring if I should lower my SHBG</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much I can do about Lp(a).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Stress.</p>

<p>2024 was certainly more stressful than 2023, which was itself generally more stressful than 2022 - all due to changing roles at work. My stress levels in June/July were elevated due to work, in September due to running a marathon and then immediately catching Covid, and finally in December due to several overnight flights and some work deadlines that required significant overtime.</p>

<p>My resting heart rate hovered around 50-51 for the year, and ultimately I would like to try and get this below 50.</p>

    <p>I have the privilege of being able to afford all those random little backpacking items, and while I don&rsquo;t baby my gear, I do try to take care of it. Especially things that keep me safe. Here&rsquo;s what I do after every trip with a few of the items.</p>
<p>I have what are probably the two most popular water filters on the market: the <a href="https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/14946-8019639-katadyn-befree-0.6L_usa">Katadyn BeFree</a> and <a href="https://sawyer.com/products/sawyer-squeeze-filter/">Sawyer Squeeze</a>. The point of this article isn&rsquo;t about comparing filters, but I recommend both: I use the BeFree for solo day hikes / fastpacking or if water is plentiful, and the Squeeze in pretty much every other situation (e.g. if I need to filter for other people). If buying now then I would be super keen to try out the <a href="https://www.platy.com/ie/filtration/quickdraw-microfilter/11458.html">Platypus QuickDraw</a>.</p>
<p>This previous weekend I came back from a quick overnight with some people and kids, so decided to take photos of the clean-up process.</p>
<h4 id="sawyer-squeeze">Sawyer Squeeze</h4>
<p>I prefer doing a backflush with the coupling unit vs. the syringe.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHLTl9N9bve4oZJ_iJTvxs0m502qYF-vVh2TC_qgeReb3fr_PGuUhuRTkPP5KZvxt51RdEBsvPVwyP5IRxOMTRkE5uVS4EvDl0G89tKuPI2j3z5wotPzT7HMmKkefsGZKHaVrwmLK4hwDU/s2048/IMG_0451.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHLTl9N9bve4oZJ_iJTvxs0m502qYF-vVh2TC_qgeReb3fr_PGuUhuRTkPP5KZvxt51RdEBsvPVwyP5IRxOMTRkE5uVS4EvDl0G89tKuPI2j3z5wotPzT7HMmKkefsGZKHaVrwmLK4hwDU/w640-h480/IMG_0451.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>Get supplies ready. Bleach, spare Sawyer bag, and blue coupling thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhGN1oHQYiz5NG9OMO9RXICG0CD5eePff1UwFgwC4K0FdO1xbdczMOP_IC-2hkOFfE1oUB2qJCsazE3LEEB3xVpsb7bAw9N6slaR0pGRTPyZwUo36mikmesk8Dadb7up0Ged30s87Ku0jD/s2048/IMG_0452.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhGN1oHQYiz5NG9OMO9RXICG0CD5eePff1UwFgwC4K0FdO1xbdczMOP_IC-2hkOFfE1oUB2qJCsazE3LEEB3xVpsb7bAw9N6slaR0pGRTPyZwUo36mikmesk8Dadb7up0Ged30s87Ku0jD/w640-h480/IMG_0452.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>Fill bag with water, add one cupful of bleach.</p>

<p>Put on blue coupling thing, but only about 1/2 way</p>

<p>Backflush. I don&rsquo;t do it like this, and use two hands instead, but had to take a photo.</p>

<p>Put cap back on and pour a little of the water in the filter. Let sit for a few hours.</p>
<h4 id="cnoc-bladder">CNOC Bladder</h4>
<p>I use this as a dirty bag if needing to filter a lot of water (e.g. group trip).</p>

<p>Put on counter and let sit for a few hours. I then put a small cup in the opening and let stand dry.</p>

<p>20 year old Platypus bladders stay in the freezer. Mainly used for running if I don&rsquo;t take my BeFree.</p>
<h4 id="gas-canister">Gas Canister</h4>
<p>I use my kitchen scale to weigh and then write down how much gas is left. This one started at 203g, and after a few overnights is 110g. Commonly these canisters weight 95g - 100g when empty, so I know I&rsquo;ve got 1-2 burns remaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJeQt-JDpFgs5zyhs6RCffj2eI8IlqwAaFZ4oFhnrYF3u9DbYoaAyokf1z0h3HQEw7XmdKpHlrv88Oh3gV91JCNeY-DduO8drcoGMy2g5PhiqYuIPrcLhbYogD35bbo4xmhi0llxhWJt_O/s2048/IMG_0463.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJeQt-JDpFgs5zyhs6RCffj2eI8IlqwAaFZ4oFhnrYF3u9DbYoaAyokf1z0h3HQEw7XmdKpHlrv88Oh3gV91JCNeY-DduO8drcoGMy2g5PhiqYuIPrcLhbYogD35bbo4xmhi0llxhWJt_O/w640-h480/IMG_0463.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>Weight on the side (~200g gross weight, 95-100g empty weight)</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. When done these all go in my &ldquo;every trip&rdquo; basket (to be fair, I don&rsquo;t take a stove quite often), and now I know I don&rsquo;t get caught out with a clogged filter or run out of fuel and drink cold coffee.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In about 2001 or 2002 I read a book called &ldquo;Beyond Backpacking - Ray Jardine&rsquo;s Guide to Lightweight Hiking&rdquo;, which set me on a path to being as light as possible. It came in very handy when I did my first section hike of the PCT, about 7 days, and I vaguely remember a total pack weight of about 25 lbs - with 4 litres of water. I was a broke college student then, so I guess clipping toothbrushes and straps really paid off. I also used a weird mesh hammock thing and I think a tarp of some kind. I have been &ldquo;ultralight&rdquo; ever since, even when renting equipment in Patagonia.</p>
<p>Anyways, the mindset has stuck 20 years later. I now am fortunate enough to have more funds to purchase better equipment, but always keen to read about recommendations on how to have a better experience and maybe even save a little weight.</p>
<p>Recently a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflIoVkAjQnyAwDKFmhRDDw">series of videos</a> was pasted on YouTube that touched on food, and they were <em>terrific</em>. I had always been pretty good about choosing which food to take. Here in Australia, my general rule of thumb was to try and get something as close to 2000kJ per 100g as possible, and then 4 or 5 stars. This insured I was getting calorie dense food, but with the videos mentioned above, I think I can now get <em>the right</em> calories.</p>
<p>I am pasting my notes below as reference purely for myself, although I might come back around and paste suitable options from Woolies or Coles that are suitable. If you have an hour or two, and like backpacking, then I really encourage you to have a watch.</p>
<p><strong>Breakfast</strong></p>
<p>Mixture of simple (high GI) and complex (low GI) carbs. Simple carbs hand off to complex carbs hand off to fats.</p>
<p>Ideal ratio for breakfast:</p>
<p>65% calories from fat</p>
<p>28% from carbs, ideally split complex/simple, maybe leaning to simple</p>
<p>7% from protein</p>
<p><strong>Trail Food</strong></p>
<p>Probably want something in the 5% - 15% calories from sugar range, unless eating smaller portions more often, and then 15% - 25%.</p>
<p>Ideal ratio for the trail:</p>
<p>65% calories from fat</p>
<p>28% from carbs, ideally split complex/simple, maybe leaning to complex</p>
<p>7% from protein</p>
<p><strong>Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink mix consumed within 15 minutes of finishing for the day.</li>
<li>Ideally a carb/protein ratio between 3:1 and 4:1. </li>
<li>Avoid fat. </li>
<li>Glucose and fructose around 3:1. </li>
<li>Frog fuel (collagen) or hydrolysed whey isolate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dinner</strong></p>
<p>Between 20 - 30g of <em>high quality</em> protein, the rest of calories rich in fat, and as close to bed time as possible for thermogenic effect.</p>
<p><strong>Electrolytes</strong></p>
<p>A few key bullet points on usage of electrolytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three states of dehydration:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hypertonic: water loss is greater in comparison to sodium loss, so serum sodium concentration increases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hypotonic: water loss is accompanied by excessive sodium loss, so serum sodium concentration decreases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isotonic: water and sodium are lost at the same rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypernatremia is a <em>result</em> of dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyponatremia is not a result of dehydration, but a result of treatment of dehydration with fluids that do not contain enough sodium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hiking for 8.5 hours @ 435mg Na/hr = 3600mg lost sodium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expected losl per hour:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Na 300 - 500</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>K 100 - 160</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mg 40 - 60</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ca 20 - 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminder that to monitor water intake, urine frequency and colour is the way to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Condition most likely to encounter on the trail is &ldquo;exercise-associated hyponatremia&rdquo;, aka drinking plenty of fluids, but not enough electrolytes. One symptom of hyponatremia is swelling, in particular in hands and feet. Ring is a sensitive instrument&hellip; &ldquo;snug fit, time to start taking on electrolytes with water. Loosey goosey? No need to supplement beyond what already get from trail snacks.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of sodium - 4,500mg would be for long days hiking in the heat</p>
<p><strong><em>In Practice</em></strong></p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/i023nd/ultralight_food_performance_nutrition_for/fzp0gf3/">follow-up comment</a> on what that might look like in practice:</p>
<p>Breakfast - a 2-serving Backpacker&rsquo;s Pantry Granola, 1240 Cal, 34g protein</p>
<p>Trail Snacks - your average Kind bar ranks as Light or Very Light, runs close to a 4:1 ratio and has an average 5g protein per 200 Cal, extrapolate for 1000 Cal of same or similar to get another 25g protein</p>
<p>Recovery Shake - Gatorade Recover packet and a Starbucks Via, gives the right ratio for 370 Cal and 21g protein</p>
<p>Dinner - Mountain House Chicken &amp; Dumplings 2-serving pouch, 600 Cal and 33g protein</p>

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I have two first aid kits: one that is in my bag when I go to work, and another when I go hiking. The one in my bag has more stuff in it, but overall the contents are pretty similar. In particular with the hiking kit I am only carrying what is likely to be used, items that cannot be improvised with what I can find, and items that I know how to use. It would be easy to <em>pack my fears</em> and include a tourniquet or triangle bandage or EpiPen, but if I allowed myself to fear that level of risk I would also wear a helmet while walking across crosswalks. The reality is I am much more likely to get blisters, minor cuts, and lots of sore muscles.</p>
<h2 id="drugs">Drugs</h2>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s it in my kit? Let&rsquo;s start with the drugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3V5DxeTIeYhvGDYEHLqhZnmzT0yQsIMDT5bPyN6J1AYXNk-80-BVQG-c-pP625AYbtJm28QtK90J7GKA__Xxg7MeqO8kPtg3pvUxAGrkjhDGW6IFjZYisBTrRF5y5fYbqWoGZlMdvRiUI/s4032/IMG_4728.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3V5DxeTIeYhvGDYEHLqhZnmzT0yQsIMDT5bPyN6J1AYXNk-80-BVQG-c-pP625AYbtJm28QtK90J7GKA__Xxg7MeqO8kPtg3pvUxAGrkjhDGW6IFjZYisBTrRF5y5fYbqWoGZlMdvRiUI/w640-h480/IMG_4728.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Lots of drugs</p>
<p>Pretty standard set of drugs I think. Here&rsquo;s why I have each in my kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paracetamol: normal headaches</li>
<li>Ibuprofen aka Vitamin I: aches and pains</li>
<li>Paracetamol + Ibuprofen: really bad headaches or pain</li>
<li>Telfast: itchies, but mainly for other people</li>
<li>Aspirin: heart attacks, but mainly for other people (very unlikely, but also weights nothing)</li>
<li>Gastro-stop: self-explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice that I keep these in little coin bags with dosage and expiry. I have noticed people previously hiking with full bottles of each of these.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the other stuff.</p>

<li>Tiny Westcott titanium sewing scissors with a set of tweezer wrapped in Velcro. Lighter than the smallest Swiss army knife, and more function on both items I might use. Tweezers are for both splinters and ticks.</li>
<li>Two sewing needles with some thread. Need better storage mechanism.</li>
<li>Some band-aids</li>
<li>Lots of Leukotape</li>
<li>Patch for inflatable</li>
<li>Patch for puffy or tent</li>
<li>One gauze pad</li>
<li>One Antibiotic gel</li>
<li>Some alcohol wipes</li>
<li>One antiseptic wipes</li>
</ul>
<p>I am always open to suggestions, but at this point I am not certain what else I would carry. I am contemplating getting rid of the gel/wipes, as I have never used them. The things I use most are the Leukotape, pain killers, and scissors. I am contemplating adding a snakebite kit if I go to more remote areas here in Australia, but if I was hiking in other countries I wouldn&rsquo;t bother.</p>

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>My hiking companion and I recently completed the Overland Track in Tasmania, and she posted a picture of our packs on a related group on Facebook. There was an overwhelming response, ranging from <em>good job!</em> to <em>you&rsquo;re a liar</em> or <em>you surely didn&rsquo;t have a tent</em> or <em>you must be on a tour and didn&rsquo;t bring food</em>.</p>
<p>I can understand the skepticism. Upon inspecting what people brought, and never used, there is definitely a preference for people to <em>pack their fears</em>. Considering this track seemed to be the first time many people have done a multi-day backpacking trip, there were a lot of things they likely would not pack after gaining a little more experience.</p>
<p>The consequences were very real. Most people had knee or foot problems by the time they reached Narcissus Hut, and I was one of only a few people able to hike out (~18km) when the ferry was cancelled (made it in about 3hr 45min and made my transport). One of my more lasting memories from the hike was stumbling on a couple hiking and one of the people being <em>unable to cross a fallen tree because their bag was too heavy</em>, and their partner had to help push them up.</p>
<p>The track was likely especially scary for newcomers given the weather we encountered was &ldquo;the worst so far this season&rdquo;, according to our track transport. A week before we went the weather was supposed to be six days of glorious 5 - 10 C temperatures with only a little drizzle. The night before we flew out of Sydney it was forecasted to snow 1 - 2 mm one of the days. The actual weather was non-stop rain or snow, temperatures ranging from -2 to 3 C, and we only saw blue sky once. Once. I don&rsquo;t remember ever seeing the sun from start-to-finish. It felt like we spent more time walking in streams or mud than on actual dry soil.</p>

<p>The Overland Track. Plan ahead and say goodbye to mobile reception.</p>
<p>Given we encountered just about the worst the trail could throw at us outside of winter, how do we know we brought just the right amount of stuff?</p>
<ol>
<li>We were one of only two parties from our van transport that even stayed in our tent</li>
<li>We never shivered a single time, nor did we think we were ever in any danger</li>
<li>The ferry was cancelled when we rolled in to Narcissus Hut, so 16 extra people had to stay overnight; about five of them didn&rsquo;t have enough food, and we were the ones giving them food because we had plenty of food remaining (that said, we were also 1 1/2 days ahead of schedule)</li>
<li>People routinely borrowed our lighter, as the piezo on their stove was broken</li>
<li>We had hot meals every night, coffee twice a day, and still had fuel left over</li>
<li>We let three people charge their phones at NH so they could sort out travel arrangements, as they didn&rsquo;t have a spare power bank</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="suggestion-from-what-we-saw">Suggestion From What We Saw</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things that we saw people bring, but with suggested substitutes that would reduce overall weight while not reducing safety or comfort. You might think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s only 50g savings&rdquo;, but it all adds up. We had by far the lightest bags with a total pack weight of around 8 kg (with 1 litre of water), and the heaviest in our van was 23kg. Most were around 15kg.</p>
<h3 id="camp-shoes">Camp Shoes</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: 2nd pair of sneakers for camp shoes</p>
<p>Better: Crocs/Flip-Flops or hotel slippers</p>
<p>Best: Plastic bags</p>
<p>A lot of people brought a 2nd pair of sneakers just for walking around the huts. Many people were a little more wise and brought a lighter pair of Crocs (good for socks, but mine weight 349g) or flip-flops (mine weigh 155g), but I&rsquo;d argue that hotel slippers (mine weigh just 39g) serve the same purpose. Or bring two bread bags and when you get to the hut take off your wet socks, put them immediately on or near the heater, put on your sleep socks, and put on bread bags on top of them. You can then wear your wet shoes without getting your sleep socks wet.</p>
<h3 id="fresh-fruit--veggies">Fresh Fruit / Veggies</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: Fresh Fruit/Veggies</p>
<p>Better: Dried fruit / dehydrated veggies</p>
<p>Best: None</p>
<p>Feel free to bring a fresh apple for lunch the first day, but fresh fruit is extremely heavy for the calories they provide. We saw people four days in giving away cucumbers / zucchini. To put this in perspective, 100g of cucumbers have 72 calories vs. 100g of peanut m&amp;m have 516 calories.</p>
<h3 id="tinned-food">Tinned Food</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: Cans of tuna</p>
<p>Better: Starkist tuna packets</p>
<p>Best: Jerkey or biltong or just nuts or peanut butter m&amp;m</p>
<p>On my first multi-day hike several years ago with this hiking companion my shopping instructions where: if it has to cook, then it needs to be able to be done in less than 3 minutes, and no cans or jars of anything. Bringing in a can of tuna, which isn&rsquo;t even that calorie dense to begin with, means you have to keep carrying that tin your entire hike. If you must bring in a tuna packet, but do a little research, as you can save significant weight by paying attention to the food you bring. Please see <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/the-5000-calories-per-day-wilderness-diet/">Skurka&rsquo;s post</a> for some overall tips, and then over at <a href="https://www.greenbelly.co/pages/best-high-calorie-backpacking-foods">Greenbelly</a> for some actual food/weight breakdown. Please see below for our food breakdown. We deviated a little bit in what we ended up buying in TAS (e.g. no banana chips), but it was plenty. If you have the time, and like planning, then consider doing the same. Alternatively, and this is the guideline I follow if I do not intend to do much planning, then try to buy food at Woolies or Coles that is as close to 2000kJ per 100g as possible.</p>

<p>Initial food planning for two</p>
<h3 id="tools--kitchen-stuff">Tools / Kitchen Stuff</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: Small cast iron skillet, hunting knives</p>
<p>Better: Not a cast iron skillet</p>
<p>A lot of people were cooking pretty elaborate meals, which is pretty impressive. They also brought four pans and three canisters of fuel. I hesitate making recommendations on food, but I&rsquo;d probably suggest getting some dehydrated meals from Snowys a few weeks in advance, and you won&rsquo;t need all those pots and pans. Another nice thing is you can use the package as a container, so one less bowl to bring and clean. Bring one spoon with a long handle (sporks might sound nice, but if you&rsquo;re eating cous cous or something small, then you can&rsquo;t easily scoop it up, and I would hesitate that you might pop a hole in a dehydrated bag).</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-clothing--cotton">Duplicate Clothing / Cotton</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing four fleeces&rdquo; or duplicates of every item</p>
<p>Best: <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/2015/backpacking-core-clothing-thirteen-3-season-conditions/">Skurka&rsquo;s Core 13</a></p>
<p>TAS Parks provides a list of minimum gear that you need to bring, but I don&rsquo;t think you need to bring more than what is on it. Even better would be to read the article by Andrew Skurka on the Core 13 items he suggests you bring. We surprisingly saw quite a bit of cotton shirts / pants being worn, which was a surprise.</p>
<h3 id="big-trowel">Big Trowel</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: Metal garden trowels</p>
<p>Better: Deuce of spaces</p>
<p>Best: Nada</p>
<p>I typically carry a &lsquo;deuce of spades&rsquo; on any overnight, but in the case of the Overland, if doing it again, I&rsquo;d probably skip bringing it. There are toilets at every site, and the ground was pretty moist, so digging a cat hold wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="water">Water</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: People carrying 5L of water</p>
<p>Better: 2L</p>
<p>Best: 1L + Sawyer Squeeze (filter)</p>
<p>When we went there was water everywhere, like, it felt like most of our time was walking in streams. If you aren&rsquo;t in a stream, then you are no more than 1km away from crossing some stream. Our van driver / ex-guide said she didn&rsquo;t filter often, but for some reason I have a fear of water, so I tend to always filter unless high up in the mountains. I brought a 1L balance water bottle and a filter, and never once needed more than that. Most of the time I just filtered at the huts and filled up there.</p>
<h3 id="first-aid-kits">First Aid Kits</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: 1kg kits from Big W</p>
<p>Better: make it yourself</p>
<p>It seems like quite a few people thought &ldquo;huh, I need a FAK, I&rsquo;ll get the next one I see&rdquo; and end up with something that has a million bandaids and big gauze pads, but nothing you actually need. You can <a href="https://www.kelvinism.com/2019/06/my-first-aid-kit-backpacking.html">see what is in my FAK</a>, which probably still has too many wipes, but I can deal with the most common issues: blisters, and soreness. It weights about 60g / 2oz.</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>Seen Brought: several hardback books</p>
<p>Better: Kindles</p>
<p>Best: skip books and chat with people or Audible</p>
<p>One lady opened her bag and pulled out <em>multiple</em> books, read for 20 minutes, then chatted with people. Bring a kindle. Or realise it is only 4 - 6 days, and leave the books at home and chat with people. I tend to load up my phone with books on Audible or podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="we-wish-we-brought">We Wish We Brought&hellip;</h2>
<p>You can read above that we had planned more for the experience than most people, and we have done several other multi-day hikes previous. I am immensely glad I read one of Ray Jardin&rsquo;s books back in ~2002 to learn how to prepare for backpacking and stop packing my fears.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much we wish we would have brought, except for perhaps some type of mittens that would have blocked the wind. When hiking on the ridges the temperature ended up dropping significantly, and when combined with the wind, it made my hands quite cold. We kept moving and that kept us generating heat, but stopping on a ridge would have been uncomfortable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently purchased an Echo from Amazon, and we were contemplating how else to better integrate it with our somewhat minimalistic home. I thought it would be interesting to get it to link to a WiFi-enabled power outlet, but unfortunately they are pretty expensive in Australia.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across the <a href="http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/">Sonoff</a> devices by Itead, and learned that they were somewhat hackable via a <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota">custom firmware</a>. Coincidentally I received the two devices on the same day my daughter was off sick, so when she had her nap, I got hacking.</p>
<p>The first bottleneck was discovering that the units I received did not have any headers. A little quick soldering later, and we had headers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzXxcHLSh3p-9YEHjtC6rnj6mJO17whJj92HUsJts2ZxD9umE7b7Rb-KUL6yFe2Ppu3ckOaoFhBmDr5yX915j97AKICugRNSOTQ-RI9dK90n6zR9J_0HnftlSFtzP-tXW0o7Q0pCrdWL1K/s1600/20180502_200103.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzXxcHLSh3p-9YEHjtC6rnj6mJO17whJj92HUsJts2ZxD9umE7b7Rb-KUL6yFe2Ppu3ckOaoFhBmDr5yX915j97AKICugRNSOTQ-RI9dK90n6zR9J_0HnftlSFtzP-tXW0o7Q0pCrdWL1K/s640/20180502_200103.jpg"></a></p>
<p>No headers mom :(</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxcIKHmY3Z3RMOShYMEGg92Tyd9QG6ENDpfn7QiDMiUtLbWhkm8smrsGYHTc7wNlkGv0f8T760LOqsISTPu7XEVetkuuIuzGOpqWQkjFOmUVo8mAyMBFju8GHWN-VLs1mCPzvdpNogJhd9/s1600/20180502_163741.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxcIKHmY3Z3RMOShYMEGg92Tyd9QG6ENDpfn7QiDMiUtLbWhkm8smrsGYHTc7wNlkGv0f8T760LOqsISTPu7XEVetkuuIuzGOpqWQkjFOmUVo8mAyMBFju8GHWN-VLs1mCPzvdpNogJhd9/s640/20180502_163741.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now we have headers!</p>
<p>A few notes of warning: the $2 programmer I got from AliExpress has 3.3v and 5v, but the <em>output</em> is 5v. I&rsquo;m glad I measured it with my multimeter, and used a random 3.3v breadboard supply instead.</p>
<p>In hindsight I wish I had just purchased the <a href="https://www.itead.cc/foca.html">FTDI programmer</a> from Itead. It looks pretty neat.</p>
<p>After following the rest of the Tasmoto <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Sonoff-S20-Smart-Socket">hardware instructions</a>, and then the <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Upload">PlatformIO instructions</a>, I was able to successfully flash both my units with the custom firmware.</p>
<p>I then created a Lambda function that sends a signal to CloudMQTT, and connected the two devices.</p>
<p>Voila!</p>

<p>While in Myanmar on a recent trip I did a brief taste comparison of the three main beers available in most supermarkets.</p>
<p><strong>Andaman</strong> - Not to my taste, perhaps like XXXX, VB, Natural Light, or a light Steel Reserve.<br>
<strong>Myanmar</strong> - Quite refreshing, a bit like similar beers in the region, e.g. Chang, Tiger, or Laos Beer.</p>
<p><strong>ABC</strong> - An extra stout (and 8%!) in such a hot country? That&rsquo;s a surprise.</p>

<p>I first used Splunk about 10 years ago after an old colleague installed it on a computer in the corner, and ever since then I have preached about it. If you have log data, of any kind, I&rsquo;d recommend you give it a go.</p>
<p>The Splunk people have a a few pretty good options for trying Splunk out, as you can either use <a href="https://www.splunkstorm.com/">Splunk Storm</a> or Splunk Free. The first option is obviously hosted, and has a generous storage option, but also does not allow long term storage of data. I send system log data to Splunk Storm.</p>
<p>However, what if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of data, but you want to keep that data forever? After reading <a href="https://twitter.com/edrabbit">Ed Hunsinger&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/10/22/go-splunk-yourself/">Go Splunk Yourself</a> entry about using it for Quantified Self data, I knew I had to do the same.</p>
<p>From personal experience, Splunk requires <em>at least</em> 1GB to even start. You can probably get it to run on less, but I haven&rsquo;t had much success. This leaves two options: look at <a href="http://lowendbox.com/">Low End Box</a> for a VPS with enough memory (as cheap as $5/month), of use <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShift</a>. Red Hat generously provides three &ldquo;gears&rdquo; to host applications, for free, and each with 1GB of memory. I have sort of a love-hate relationship with OpenShift, maybe a bit like using OAuth. Red Hat calls OpenShift the &ldquo;Open Hybrid Cloud Application Platform&rdquo;, and I can attest that it is really this. They have provided a method to bundle an application stack and push it into production without needing to fuss about infrastructure, or even provisioning and management of the application. It feels like what would happen if Google App Engine and Amazon&rsquo;s EC2 had a child. Heroku or dotCloud might be its closest alternatives.</p>
<p>Anyways, this isn&rsquo;t a review of OpenShift, although it would be a positive review, but instead on how to use OpenShift to host Splunk. I first installed Splunk in a gear using Nginx as a proxy, and it worked. However, this felt overly complex, and after one of <a href="https://twitter.com/aeriadesign">my colleagues</a> started working on installing Splunk in a cartridge, I eventually agreed this would be the way to go. The result was a Splunk cartridge that can be installed inside any existing gear. Here are the instructions; you need an OpenShift account, obviously. The install should take less than ten clicks of your mouse, and one copy/paste.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/kelvinn/openshift-splunk-cartridge">cartridge</a>&rsquo;s GitHub README:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an Application based on existing web framework. If in doubt, just pick &ldquo;Do-It-Yourself 0.1&rdquo; or &ldquo;Python 2.7&rdquo;</li>
<li>Click on &ldquo;Continue to the application overview page.&rdquo;</li>
<li>On the Application page, click on &ldquo;Or, see the entire list of cartridges you can add&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Under &ldquo;Install your own cartridge&rdquo; enter the following URL: <a href="https://raw.github.com/kelvinn/openshift-splunk-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml">https://raw.github.com/kelvinn/openshift-splunk-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml</a></li>
<li>Next and Add Cartrdige. Wait a few minutes for Splunk to download and install.</li>
<li>Logon to Splunk at: <a href="https://your-app.rhcloud.com/ui">https://your-app.rhcloud.com/ui</a></li>
</ol>
<p>More details can be read on the cartridge&rsquo;s GitHub page, and I would especially direct you to the <a href="https://github.com/kelvinn/openshift-splunk-cartridge#limitations">limitations</a> of this configuration. This will all stop working if Splunk makes the installer file unavailable, but I will deal with that when the time comes. Feel free to alert me if this happens.</p>

    <p>I was talking to a friend about what education levels might look like across Sydney, and a friend challenged me to map it. The below map is my first draft.</p>
<p>The map was derived by combining three datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (<a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/">ABS</a> - a department releasing some great datasets). The first dataset was the spatial data for &ldquo;SA2&rdquo; level boundaries, the second the population data for various geographic areas, and the third from the 2011 Census on Non-School Qualification Level of Education (e.g. Certificates, Diplomas, Masters, Doctorates). I aggregated all people with bachelors or higher in an SA2 region, and then divided that number by the total number of people in that region. A different methodology could have been used.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I should have paid more attention to mapping education levels. I mapped the percentage of overall population, but should have mapped the percentage of 25 to 34 year olds, as this would have aligned to various government metrics.</p>
<p>Reported education levels differ vastly by region, e.g. &ldquo;North Sydney - Lavender Bay&rdquo; (40%) vs. &ldquo;Bidwell - Hebersham - Emerton&rdquo; (3%). It is interesting to look at the different <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/mapping-urban-density-in-sydney.html">urban density levels</a> of the areas, as well as the <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/08/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-2.html">commute times to the nearest centre</a>.</p>
<p>Without trying to sound too elitist, I was hoping to use this map to guide me where to consider buying our next property (i.e. looking for a well educated, clean area with decent schools and frequent public transport). It was interesting to discover that the SA2 region we currently live in has the second highest percentage in NSW.</p>

    <p>In <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-1.html">Sydney Commute Times Mapped Part 1</a> I took a small step to a bigger goal of mashing together public transport in Sydney, and the <a href="http://strategies.planning.nsw.gov.au/Portals/0/Documents/MetroCommunityGuide.pdf">Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney to 2031</a>. The question I wanted to answer is this: how aligned is Sydney&rsquo;s public transport infrastructure and the Metropolitan Strategy&rsquo;s of a &ldquo;city of cities&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I decided to find out.</p>
<p>Thanks to the release of GTFS data by 131500 it is possible to visualise how long it takes via public transport to commute to the nearest &ldquo;centre&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDc0IriO971A2BQ7F9Nu1zYVZ_uO5OEwv8n0Z9vpPB1IElGYMI0r5bzCah9UCv5fqNzthkaHnPFBN6Pd5PD32GL_xXUJDAYKvXdx3OK8DwtotghU_PDA_Mc_qWYa8gUEKiJxj8Uos4mYbk/s1600/CItyOfCities.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDc0IriO971A2BQ7F9Nu1zYVZ_uO5OEwv8n0Z9vpPB1IElGYMI0r5bzCah9UCv5fqNzthkaHnPFBN6Pd5PD32GL_xXUJDAYKvXdx3OK8DwtotghU_PDA_Mc_qWYa8gUEKiJxj8Uos4mYbk/s1600/CItyOfCities.png"></a></p>

<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics collects data based on &ldquo;mesh blocks&rdquo;, or roughly an area containing roughly 50 dwellings. Last week I had some fun <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/mapping-mesh-blocks-with-tilemill.html">mapping the mesh blocks</a>, as well as looking at Sydney&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/mapping-urban-density-in-sydney.html">urban densities</a>. These mesh blocks are a good size to look at for calculating commute times.</p>
<p>The simplified process I used was this, for the technical minded:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the centre of each mesh block</li>
<li>Calculate the commute time via public transport from each block to every &ldquo;centre&rdquo; (using 131500&rsquo;s GTFS and OpenTripPlanner&rsquo;s Analyst tool)</li>
<li>Import times in a database, calculate lowest commute time to each centre</li>
<li>Visualise in TileMill</li>
<li>Serve tiles in TileStache and visualise with Leaflet</li>
</ol>
<p>The first map I created was simply to indicate how long it would take to the nearest centre. There appears to be rapidly poorer accessibility on the fringe of Sydney. I was also surprised of what appears to be a belt of higher times between Wetherill Park and all the way to Marrickville. There also appears to be poorer accessibility in <em>parts</em> of Western Sydney. It is worth noting that I offer not guarantee of the integrity of the data in these maps, and I have seen a few spots where the commute times increase significantly in adjacent mesh blocks. This tells me the street data (from OpenStreetMap) might not be connected correctly.</p>

<p>My next map shows what areas are within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>These maps were both created using open data and open source tools, which I find quite neat. In that spirit, I have exported the database (probably a bit hard for most to work with) to a Shapefile. You can open this in TileMill and experiment, if you wish. Download it from <a href="http://cdn.kelvinism.com/mb_2011_nsw_transport.zip">here</a> (note: 250MB zip file):</p>
<p>I have been interested in mapping traffic for a number of years, maybe ever since arriving in Sydney. It is sort of a hobby; I find making maps relaxing. My first little map was way back in 2008, where I <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/04/baby-steps-at-graphing-traffic_522.html">visualised speed</a> from a GPS unit. A little later I added <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/04/another-baby-step_1340.html">some colour to the visualisations</a>, and then used this as an excuse to create a little <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/05/gui-to-plot-driving-speed_6997.html">GUI for driving speed</a>. My interest in visualising individual vehicles has decreased recently, as it has now shifted to the mapping wider systems. Have an idea you would like to see mapped?
