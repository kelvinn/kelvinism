      <title>State of Health: 2024</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2025/01/state-of-health-2024.html</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, probably in late 2022, I was doing some self-reflection and was pondering what the next constraint was for improving my health. Depending on whom you ask, there are generally several areas of focus when it comes to health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metabolic health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing or screenings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplementation or pharmacological interventions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I reached after seeing/eating more of my partner&amp;rsquo;s diet is that nutrition was the next area for me to focus on. My approach has typically been to deep dive on reading books, and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve read the following books related to nutrition and longevity:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post Backpacking Trip Clean-Up</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/04/post-backpacking-trip-clean-up.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 10:19:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2021/04/post-backpacking-trip-clean-up.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have the privilege of being able to afford all those random little backpacking items, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t baby my gear, I do try to take care of it. Especially things that keep me safe. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do after every trip with a few of the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have what are probably the two most popular water filters on the market: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/14946-8019639-katadyn-befree-0.6L_usa&#34;&gt;Katadyn BeFree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sawyer.com/products/sawyer-squeeze-filter/&#34;&gt;Sawyer Squeeze&lt;/a&gt;. The point of this article isn&amp;rsquo;t about comparing filters, but I recommend both: I use the BeFree for solo day hikes / fastpacking or if water is plentiful, and the Squeeze in pretty much every other situation (e.g. if I need to filter for other people). If buying now then I would be super keen to try out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.platy.com/ie/filtration/quickdraw-microfilter/11458.html&#34;&gt;Platypus QuickDraw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ultralight Backpacking - Food &amp; Electrolytes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/08/ultralight-backpacking-food.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 20:11:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2020/08/ultralight-backpacking-food.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In about 2001 or 2002 I read a book called &amp;ldquo;Beyond Backpacking - Ray Jardine&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Lightweight Hiking&amp;rdquo;, which set me on a path to being as light as possible. It came in very handy when I did my first section hike of the PCT, about 7 days, and I vaguely remember a total pack weight of about 25 lbs - with 4 litres of water. I was a broke college student then, so I guess clipping toothbrushes and straps really paid off. I also used a weird mesh hammock thing and I think a tarp of some kind. I have been &amp;ldquo;ultralight&amp;rdquo; ever since, even when renting equipment in Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Aid Kit (Backpacking)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2019/06/my-first-aid-kit-backpacking.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 21:23:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2019/06/my-first-aid-kit-backpacking.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two first aid kits: one that is in my bag when I go to work, and another when I go hiking. The one in my bag has more stuff in it, but overall the contents are pretty similar. In particular with the hiking kit I am only carrying what is likely to be used, items that cannot be improvised with what I can find, and items that I know how to use. It would be easy to &lt;em&gt;pack my fears&lt;/em&gt; and include a tourniquet or triangle bandage or EpiPen, but if I allowed myself to fear that level of risk I would also wear a helmet while walking across crosswalks. The reality is I am much more likely to get blisters, minor cuts, and lots of sore muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Overland Track Lighter Pack Tips</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2019/05/overland-track-lighter-pack-tips.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 21:53:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2019/05/overland-track-lighter-pack-tips.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hiking companion and I recently completed the Overland Track in Tasmania, and she posted a picture of our packs on a related group on Facebook. There was an overwhelming response, ranging from &lt;em&gt;good job!&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re a liar&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;you surely didn&amp;rsquo;t have a tent&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;you must be on a tour and didn&amp;rsquo;t bring food&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand the skepticism. Upon inspecting what people brought, and never used, there is definitely a preference for people to &lt;em&gt;pack their fears&lt;/em&gt;. Considering this track seemed to be the first time many people have done a multi-day backpacking trip, there were a lot of things they likely would not pack after gaining a little more experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2018/05/ys-and-i-recently-purchased-echo-from.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased an Echo from Amazon, and we were contemplating how else to better integrate it with our somewhat minimalistic home. I thought it would be interesting to get it to link to a WiFi-enabled power outlet, but unfortunately they are pretty expensive in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I stumbled across the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/&#34;&gt;Sonoff&lt;/a&gt; devices by Itead, and learned that they were somewhat hackable via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota&#34;&gt;custom firmware&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally I received the two devices on the same day my daughter was off sick, so when she had her nap, I got hacking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While in Myanmar on a recent trip I did a brief taste comparison of the three main beers available in most supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andaman&lt;/strong&gt; - Not to my taste, perhaps like XXXX, VB, Natural Light, or a light Steel Reserve.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt; - Quite refreshing, a bit like similar beers in the region, e.g. Chang, Tiger, or Laos Beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABC&lt;/strong&gt; - An extra stout (and 8%!) in such a hot country? That&amp;rsquo;s a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Free Splunk Hosting</title>

&lt;p&gt;I first used Splunk about 10 years ago after an old colleague installed it on a computer in the corner, and ever since then I have preached about it. If you have log data, of any kind, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Splunk people have a a few pretty good options for trying Splunk out, as you can either use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splunkstorm.com/&#34;&gt;Splunk Storm&lt;/a&gt; or Splunk Free. The first option is obviously hosted, and has a generous storage option, but also does not allow long term storage of data. I send system log data to Splunk Storm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sydney&#39;s Education Levels Mapped</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/sydneys-education-levels-mapped.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2013 10:45:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/09/sydneys-education-levels-mapped.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend about what education levels might look like across Sydney, and a friend challenged me to map it. The below map is my first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map was derived by combining three datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abs.gov.au/&#34;&gt;ABS&lt;/a&gt; - a department releasing some great datasets). The first dataset was the spatial data for &amp;ldquo;SA2&amp;rdquo; level boundaries, the second the population data for various geographic areas, and the third from the 2011 Census on Non-School Qualification Level of Education (e.g. Certificates, Diplomas, Masters, Doctorates). I aggregated all people with bachelors or higher in an SA2 region, and then divided that number by the total number of people in that region. A different methodology could have been used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sydney Commute Times Mapped Part 2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/08/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-2.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 07:55:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/08/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-2.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-1.html&#34;&gt;Sydney Commute Times Mapped Part 1&lt;/a&gt; I took a small step to a bigger goal of mashing together public transport in Sydney, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://strategies.planning.nsw.gov.au/Portals/0/Documents/MetroCommunityGuide.pdf&#34;&gt;Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney to 2031&lt;/a&gt;. The question I wanted to answer is this: how aligned is Sydney&amp;rsquo;s public transport infrastructure and the Metropolitan Strategy&amp;rsquo;s of a &amp;ldquo;city of cities&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the release of GTFS data by 131500 it is possible to visualise how long it takes via public transport to commute to the nearest &amp;ldquo;centre&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quantified Self Interview</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/quantified-self-interview.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2013 16:44:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/quantified-self-interview.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;YS and I were recently interviewed about self-tracking and Quantified Self by one of the major news channels in Australia. I will reflect on the experience after the show has aired, but it was an overall great experience. We have a new respect for filming what may ultimately be just a two minute segment. Depending on how the editing is done it will either provoke the hosts to contemplate the value of a data-centric macroscopic view of the world, or give them lots of fodder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coffee, Beer, Wine and Time of Day</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/coffee-beer-wine-and-time-of-day.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/coffee-beer-wine-and-time-of-day.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like Tableau, a piece of software to visualise data, is that it aggregates on dates really well. Below is a spread of beer / wine / coffee over 18 months, but grouped by what hour is fell in. You can see some trends, like I usually consume coffee in the morning, and that I usually drink after 17:00. There are exceptions, of course, like that beer I had at 10AM, and that coffee I had at 1AM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some QS Numbers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/some-qs-numbers.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 08:26:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2013/07/some-qs-numbers.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is the possibility I will be giving an interview on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self&#34;&gt;Quantified Self&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo;. What follows is a brief summary of QS, the things I track, and some pretty charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Quantified Self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on who you talk to. Wikipedia states that it is &amp;ldquo;a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person&amp;rsquo;s daily life in terms of inputs&amp;rdquo;, but I side more on the idea that the movement is &amp;ldquo;a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking.&amp;rdquo; It is at this point that it is probably important to interject that most people are self-trackers: weight, height, reps at the gym, hours worked, and so forth. If you have ever made a goal, you probably tracked how you could reach it. What makes us QS folk a bit different is that we tend to track &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of things, correlate between them, and share our results. So, with this theme, let me share what I track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quite like open data. I like data based on open standards (or mostly open standards) even better. Many transport operators around the world have started releasing their timetable data using (mostly) open standards, e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification&#34;&gt;GTFS&lt;/a&gt;. One of the nice things about using a standard is that clever people have created tools to work with the timetable data, and those tools can now be used to manipulate timetable data from hundreds of agencies. The magnificent OpenTripPlanner is one such tool, and it works well with &lt;a href=&#34;http://131500.info/&#34;&gt;131500&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s GTFS data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years ago I started exploring different mapping technologies by detailing instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/04/setting-up-mapnik-server-on-ubuntu_118.html&#34;&gt;installing Mapnik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2008/11/revised-modtile-install-howto_1369.html&#34;&gt;mod_tile&lt;/a&gt;. Times have changed significantly in the last five years, and thanks a lot to the products offered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mapbox.com/&#34;&gt;MapBox&lt;/a&gt;. After playing with TileMill, MBTiles, Leaflet and UTFGrids, it is great how many annoyances have been fixed by MapBox. I find it enjoyable making maps now, as I no longer need to worry about patching code just to get it to run, or mucking about with oddities in web browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although we did some research before doing the trek, it turns out we made a number of assumptions that turned out to be incorrect. I will detail in this entry what we learned, a few things that worked well, and a few things that did not work so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to avoid posting spoilers of the major sites, and instead focus on logistics of doing the trek. First things first: much of this content is from what we learned at a talk given at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.erraticrock.com/&#34;&gt;Erratic Rock&lt;/a&gt; hostel, at 3PM the day before entering the park. The single biggest suggestion I would give you is to go to this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February I gave a presentation to about 80 people at the Sydney Python group hosted by Atlassian. Firstly, Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s office was beautiful, feeling a little like Google&amp;rsquo;s Sydney office, but with beer on tap instead of cereal dispensers. Secondly, the talk before me on Cython by &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/113985890803565448326/posts&#34;&gt;Aaron Defazio&lt;/a&gt; was exceptionally interesting, garnering lots of questions from the audience. My presentation, more of a show and tell on piping location data to Google&amp;rsquo;s Latitude through App Engine, was also meant to subtly share my views on the need for innovation in the public sector (all sectors, really).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Kathmandu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first trip to Kathmandu is now over, so there are some lessons learned I should scribe. Some of these are obvious, and which we abide by whenever travelling, and some we simply forgot in our (very) impromptu trip to Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When agreeing on a price, make 100% sure the other person states the price back to you. I thought a price had been agreed to when the other person responded &amp;ldquo;ok ok, you are a lucky man&amp;rdquo;, but this does not count. As they say, reconfirm, reconfirm, reconfirm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Goodbye Facebook</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I seldom used Facebook, and felt a bit depressed after logging on each time. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I am alone, but each time still felt a bit like a secret spitting contest. A bit, not a lot, but sort of subconsciously. Oh, he has a nice (sounding) job. -1 I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled more than her. +3 The old school cool guy is back living with his parents. +3 She has five kids already - I knew that would happen! -5 Honestly, though, even at an involuntary subconscious level, I don&amp;rsquo;t like spitting contests. I would rather be sharing ideas or creating something. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>131500trains Updates to GTalk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little hack I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share. There are maybe other ways to do this, but this way took all of two minutes, which suits me. My daily routine has me taking a train along the Inner West Line (here in Sydney), and I wanted to know in advance if there was any issues with the line. 131500 provides weekely emails about upcoming trackwork, and there&amp;rsquo;s an RSS feed of delays; this is what you&amp;rsquo;d see in many of the Sydney transport-related apps. Another information source is through Twitter. For all of these sources I only really care about the one line I take every day - the quickest answer would seem to be if I could only get updates on Twitter for my line&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned: Losing Parts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve lost tiny parts and had to spend time trying to find them. I realized after removing the back of my monitor that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn from those mistakes; instead of just sticking the screws in a box with other screws, and then having to dig them out, I taped them to the back of the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OqMPZv-C1FIlFQUDle20ttMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdsrGGIgIwudUyykswXY0FS7wK2fssrepfNQqldElC7NFgom4pMNJ8amETDCayCKzgOkMeJFNlSNbC4y6lOs9Oj9fK1i5DWNpTF5CoRr_h0rb1s-OUm88qoNyODThD1zm4vmh0Ygt1a3Qu/s400/IMG_20111103_191634.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds small, but after doing it I realised how many times I had to hunt through a box of screws trying to find the exact one that fit. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A short while ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/articles/visualizing-transport/&#34;&gt;visualizing transport&lt;/a&gt; by using 131500&amp;rsquo;s TDX data, converted to GTFS, and served by GeoServer. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve started &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/travelmap/&#34;&gt;playing around&lt;/a&gt; with Google&amp;rsquo;s Fusion table, I thought it would be interesting to see what all the transit stops in Sydney look like in FT. So, voila!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had several conversations with neighbors and co-workers about the &amp;ldquo;lack&amp;rdquo; of forward thinking, or at least the lack of forward action. Of course, I keep in the back of my mind that we aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo;, and the more I learn about transport the more I learn how complex it is. Dr. Sussman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;CLIOS&lt;/em&gt; process (Complex, Large-&lt;br&gt;
Scale, Integrated, Open Systems) appears more and more true the longer I work in and study transport. There is a plethora of excuses that can be made, but the general conclusion was that the earlier we prepare the better. I can remember working near Zhongshan 7-8 years ago and driving around on huge roads in the middle of empty fields. There weren&amp;rsquo;t even stoplights at every intersection. It was then that I had an epiphany of how smart the planning was to build the infrastructure &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the masses arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having some issues with my personal mail server (Postfix) and my phone (Android). The logs depicted the below issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jan  9 09:19:53 ip-11-222-23-223 postfix/smtpd\[12345\]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from 12-13-14-15.abc.com.au\[12.13.14.15\]: 504 5.5.2 : Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname; from= to= proto=ESMTP helo= 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see here that the stock Android email client is doing a &amp;lsquo;helo localhost&amp;rsquo;. One part of my main.cf file specifies this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smtpd\_helo\_required = yes

    reject\_invalid\_helo\_hostname,
    permit\_sasl\_authenticated,
    permit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To resolve, unfortunately, just change the order to authenticated clients are permitted earlier:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I saw an opening to give a 5-10 minute lightening talk at SyPy (Sydney Python), and with two nights to prepare, decided it would be interesting to explore Splunk&amp;rsquo;s usage of Python. Below was the quick presentation I gave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retiring Another Site</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2010/05/retiring-another-site_942.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2010/05/retiring-another-site_942.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After much consideration, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to retire yet another website: Colddirt. This site was created as an example of how to use the different parts of Django, mostly in just one afternoon. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it is time to just take a few screenshots and retire the site - the domain is expiring, and honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend $10 to renew the domain. So, here are the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ePVyNddWOBJSJWqEIhYalw?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi09jrZynm_kNvbfNESRQ9Dp8epPrHZ2iIrLNkGcoV2XpenNw51zVDWyq9rQmtdnYtabIsTnGaN0G9cWio2VhwKEmXkAdDd0ec0E6yr4uLeokPiZrVVMhoy3b9Ud34QWHHpPAueSWNnn_So/s400/colddirt_2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RIP Old Sites</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2010/05/rip-old-sites_7527.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve created several websites, some with the hope of becoming big and popular. Naturally, I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting to create a site that becomes big and popular. In the meantime, it seems appropriate to retire some of the older sites and ideas. The truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m moving all my little sites from MySQL on a mediocre VPS to Postgresql on EC2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I put some sweat and blood into these sites, I thought it would be only appropriate to record how the sites looked for future sentimental value. I downloaded a small plug-in for Firefox to take full-length pictures, and I thus post them here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fun with OSM</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2010/02/fun-with-osm_3920.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, to me, editing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.org/&#34;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; is actually a little therapeutic. Sort of like gardening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first major contribution was when I brought my little QStarz GPS unit across Indonesia, by train, sitting against the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/a9waevHOnamwhJuZ0631AQ?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVRc8DuYUf5aDc9yLzjBA5JZmXTczhYyV8R4LeLVmss6J1D7RvhUo5MvP-NRqbOQ7a-v9UBY0vqlIEG_nXnQ0XJ3cZjDGBtmAygoJNRUu7R3ptkL7TtnRQM3fnRYhq01LZjLCLi6b2c3ll/s288/indorailroad.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent contribution was our trip to Dubbo, where I helped fill in a few missing roads, and added an initial outlay of Dubbo Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a GPS or have $60 to spend on one, and like anything CAD-drawing like, give editing OSM a try!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last year YS and I have been studying French once a week (4.5hr on Saturday!) A few months ago I wrote some Python code to read the RSS feeds of the most popular French newspaper site, and then kept track of the count of each word. I repeated this every week for a few months.&lt;br&gt;
In the end I had a database of the top ~3000 words used on the site. Today I decided I wanted to play with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/www.processing.org&#34;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;, so created this little word collage. It is 1680x1050, my monitor&amp;rsquo;s resolution. Two thumbs up for Processing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For one of my projects I&amp;rsquo;m testing an SMS gateway, and decided it would be fun to build a useful alarm clock out of it. For those of you who know Python, you may find this funny. /dev/ttyUSB0 is my Arduino with a temperature sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import serial

return float(t)

t = check\_temp()
if int(t) &amp;lt; 8:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to childhood. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, fun over, back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to purchase an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arduino.cc/&#34;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;, for no other reason than to play with. Like a kid. My Arduino arrived two days ago. This is a story of problems, but not the pull-your-hair-out type, more the&amp;hellip; like when you run out of gas in the middle of Sydney. Going to your Christmas dinner. In your friend&amp;rsquo;s car. Long story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a simple, no-hassles GPS display program for Linux, and I believe I finally found one: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangogps.org/gps/cat/About&#34;&gt;TangoGPS&lt;/a&gt;. My requirements were quite simple; I needed something that would talk to gpsd, and display a dot on OpenStreetMaps. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do this in other programs (even in 3d in WorldWind), but I wanted something to download the maps for me, and GTK+ would be a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TangoGPS was easy to install (apt-get install tangogps), and on my test &amp;lsquo;drive&amp;rsquo; home tonight on the train, worked a treat. See related screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this issue happen to me several times, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally writing myself a note to fix it in the future. There seems to be an issue with downloading VMWare Workstation (.bundle). I first tried it with Firefox, but it just crapped out at loading it into /tmp. Next, I tried it with Lynx, but alas, it tried to download it as a text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahah! The quickest solution I could find is to right click the link, save as, and save it as a zip. Rename it to .bundle when you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve written up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://kelvinism.com/howtos/installing-debian-50-vortex86dx/&#34;&gt;short tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on the method I used to install Debian 5.0 on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I purchased the eBox-3300 from WDL Systems. The system was promptly shipped, and there were no &amp;ldquo;gotchas&amp;rdquo; from WDL. The little box fit my exact needs - it is small, and built very, very well. I flew back to Australia and, after some trial and error, installed Debian 5.0 on it. For quite some time I was just using the vmlinuz file provided by WDL, which was provided by ICOP (DMP). This worked well, but there were two issues:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After restoring databases from one server to another I sometimes get this error on Ubuntu or Debian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;error: &amp;#39;Access denied for user &amp;#39;debian-sys-maint&amp;#39;@&amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39; (using password: YES)&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes a lot of sense, and the solution is pretty simple. If you look in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see the defaults for your system. Copy the password listed there, and open a connection to MySQL as root (or some other user). Next, enter this (lets say your password specified in debian.cnf was &amp;lsquo;abracadabra&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000 I managed to acquire several retired systems to bring to Uni: this included 4-5 cheap P120 machines. At the time, I thought this was great; I had an OpenBSD box as my gateway, a FreeBSD box, a few Linux boxes, and likely something else that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even exist now. The school has a superfast connection, unlimited bandwidth, and I was curious. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, I still managed to install and have all these servers running from my room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Renaming Apache Log Locations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them. I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file. logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log &amp;ndash; e.g. kelvinism_access_log. I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon offers some pretty cool services: S3, EC2, Alexa Site Thumbnail, and others. A while back I wanted to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/ast/&#34;&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djangoproject.com&#34;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, so ended up writing the Python bindings to the REST API (they didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist. I even wrote up a quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/howtos/alexa-site-thumbnail-and-django/&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Amazon no longer maintains AST. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/rip-old-sites/&#34;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; a few of the old sites, so no longer need to take thumbnails. However, a few other thumbnail services seem to have crept up, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://snapcasa.com/&#34;&gt;SnapCasa&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.websnapr.com/&#34;&gt;WebSnapr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A normal internet connection gets attacked, a lot. The majority of attacks are of the form &amp;ldquo;hello, anybody there?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; where most people just don&amp;rsquo;t answer. But sometimes, just sometimes, the question gets an answer. Depending on the answer, the attacker will start to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I was a little bored and started fiddling. I wanted to play with my Cisco, but also wanted to play with OSSEC, but also has a GIS craving. In the end I decided to create a map of the people who ask, &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the need to move a rather large (450GB) VMDK file from an external hard drive into ESXi. Since ESXi doesn&amp;rsquo;t support external hard drives, this makes things quite a bit more difficult. At first I tried using SCP to copy the file over (after enabling SSH access for ESXi). However, when I tried to do this the time left was almost 20 hours &amp;ndash; a tad too long!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues before with OpenFiler where doesn&amp;rsquo;t update the permissions, although they appear correct in the UI. To rectify that, I stumbled upon a one liner that fixed it. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a group called &amp;ldquo;Trusted&amp;rdquo; that you want to have full access to your music folder. Here&amp;rsquo;s the one-liner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\[root@files data\]# pwd
/mnt/openfiler/data
root@files data\]# setfacl --recursive -m u:nobody:rwx,g:Trusted:rwx music

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found VMWare Server to have very slow I/O, and sought to improve it. Below are a list of tests I performed, the change, and the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rank OSSEC as one of my favorite pieces of open source software, and finally decided to play around with it more in my own free time. (Yup, I do this sort of stuff for &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;). My goal was quite simple: send syslog packets from my Cisco to my &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; server, running OSSEC. I found that, although OSSEC supports Cisco IOS logging, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really work. In fact, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any examples or articles of anybody actually getting it to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting the exact string to enter at the CLI for updating the IOS on a wireless Cisco AP, so I&amp;rsquo;ll just put it here to end my future searches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;192.168.83.150 obviously being your tftp server, and the .tar file sitting in the root of the tftp server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose if you wanted to backup your IOS you could do something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I do sysadminy stuff all day, I don&amp;rsquo;t really get a chance to do much coding (or not as much of a chance as I would like). You can imagine my joy when my girlfriend expressed a problem she needed solved: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to solve 100s of slope equations, i.e. where two lines intersect. Can you write a program to do it?&amp;rdquo; Sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if she wanted to do a batch input or just a one-off type of deal, she decided on the latter. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve done a fair bit of PyGTK stuff, I had never actually needed to convert it to Windows. I debated using IronPython &amp;ndash; but needed to use a special library to help solve the equations (I&amp;rsquo;m lazy).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in several different parts of the world, and they all do internet differently. Back in the US I had 8Mb/sec cable (leaving just before Fios was really an option, darn!) In New Zealand, for instance, I was paying for &amp;ldquo;high speed ADSL&amp;rdquo; rated at 1.5Mb/256k. Vrooom. Up in Taiwan I was paying 1/2 what I paid in New Zealand, but for 12Mb/1Mb. Down to Sydney and we have a rated 24Mb/1Mb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think possibly one of the most practical upgrades in VMware Server 2 appears to be the ability to automatically turn on virtual machines in a stagnated order. I have fond memories of turning on a server with 10 virtual machines, and when they all turn on at once, the hard disk grinds to a halt. This forced me to turn on the machines manually afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+1 VMware in my books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed another Python fix, and I need one pretty badly. I spent the weekend wondering why it appears to be impossible to edit the GUIDs inside an Exchange mailbox store (read: NOT the GUIDs stored in AD for Exchange). Anyways, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals were simple. I wanted to use Python, wanted something to do with traffic, and wanted to play around with Glade/PyGTK and graphing stuff. My end result was a little app that allows you to specify a GPX file, and it plots the waypoints (and calculates the moving average!). Pretty simple, pretty useless, but pretty fun. I really do like pretty pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I showed a few of my co-workers my graph and one replied &amp;ndash; oh! that&amp;rsquo;s really cool. (I think only two of my co-workers are actually interested in my geekyness). He then emailed me tonight a .kmz file containing a colorized file of his speed. I looked at the kml and noticed it appeared to be dynamically allocated judging by the top speed. Well, as you could guess, I surely had to modify my code to include colors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently have been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/tech-blog/baby-steps-graphing-traffic/&#34;&gt;playing&lt;/a&gt; with parsing GPX files and spitting out the results into a special KML file. I initially wrote a parser using minidom, yet after running this the first time &amp;ndash; and my Core2Duo laptop reaching 100% utilization for 10 seconds &amp;ndash; I realized I needed to re-write it using something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a little time reading the different parsers for XML and eventually read more about &lt;a href=&#34;http://effbot.org/zone/celementtree.htm&#34;&gt;cElementTree&lt;/a&gt;. And it is included with Python2.5, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status:&lt;br&gt;
You can likely tell that I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some fun with graphing and mapping recently. I was reading a few articles about GIS and stumbled upon a pretty darn cool project at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webopticon.com/projects/neighborhood_nets&#34;&gt;Webopticon&lt;/a&gt;, which included cool pictures. I showed it to my girlfriend thinking she would find it interesting, and then realized: oh! KML has an altitude attribute. That could be interesting.&lt;br&gt;
One of my projects is to create &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2007/12/sydneys-driving-habits.html&#34;&gt;maps of Sydney&amp;rsquo;s traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I have been experimenting heavily with Mapnik and OSM. I figured I could have some fun and finally parse some gps tracks and display the data.&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new guest VMs under Xen seem to be having issues where upon each reboot, the network interface gets incremented by 1. For instance, it starts at eth0, then goes to eth1, then eth2, and eventually ethX. There are two issues to fix: 1) get the count back to 0, and 2) stop it from counting again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to get them to decrease by looking in the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file and removing all entries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have managed to install mapnik 0.4, 0.5, 0.5.1 and various SVN releases in-between on Ubuntu. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t in itself exciting, I think I manage to stumble at every installation. I typically forget to add the flags when building, so, to prevent myself from stumbling again, I&amp;rsquo;m going to write them out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build mapnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally decided to do another remodel of this site. I had a few goals before starting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use one image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the YUI-CSS framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Django&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it easily extendable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished these goals. The site is easier to read, easy to modify, and has a few new features. More entries to come!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Database Woopsie</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2008/02/database-woopsie_863.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I returned to my computer today to notice I had the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(145, &amp;#34;Table &amp;#39;./databasename/comments\_freecomment&amp;#39; is marked as crashed and should be repaired&amp;#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, crap. The solution is quite easy, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqlcheck -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments\_freecomment
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you know what you already know, you can fix it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mysqlcheck -r -uUsername -pPassword databasename comments\_freecomment
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you can try a slightly different method. First, go to the location where your databases are stored on the disk (most likely something like /var/lib/mysql/databasename). Next, stop the database &amp;ndash; and try to free up as much memory as possible. Then run:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GPS on the SkypePhone</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2008/02/gps-on-skypephone_9589.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2008/02/gps-on-skypephone_9589.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was sort of curious if I could use my 3 Skypephone in a pinch if I got lost, which here in Sydney, happens quite often. Luckily 3&amp;rsquo;s Skypephone has both Bluetooth, and supports j2me apps. Mobile GPS unit, here I come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3AY6h-qKwGk9NpnB9hrwsw?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjExWMS7zKJdGCG_1MHdpb900yTseLCrbHerf2PlfzwSouqfnmJHr5V1jiIcDcbMrEul2OZUFlCYOQhTgrq_3C-cYDWmxkx-yDOr6NNwokX8P-gUikt3DSjxRi11qJrMuP4_aSRLpjhLPax/s288/DSC03368.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe to get maps on your Skypephone is pretty darn easy. You&amp;rsquo;ll need one dash bluetooth GPS receiver (I have the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qstarz.com/Products/GPS%20Products/BT-Q1000.html&#34;&gt;Qstarz BT-Q1000&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&#34;http://linuxtechs.net/kruch/tb/forum/index.php&#34;&gt;TrekBuddy&lt;/a&gt;, a TrekBuddy acceptable map (&lt;a href=&#34;http://osm.bandnet.org/browse/?1,1,1,0&#34;&gt;easily downloadable&lt;/a&gt;), and one dab computer &amp;ndash; but since you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I figure you&amp;rsquo;ve got that part taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Size of Uncompressed OSM File</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2008/01/size-of-uncompressed-osm-file_95.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.com&#34;&gt;OSM&lt;/a&gt; a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map. At first I wanted to do it on my VPS &amp;ndash; but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn&amp;rsquo;t a way. Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database. Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have (although I&amp;rsquo;m writing some code that might make this possible in the future).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Distcc</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2008/01/using-distcc_1425.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of working on one of my projects, and the requirement came up to download a fairly large file (4GB). Since I only receive ~20GB/month at my house, I decided to just use my server in the U.S. The next requirement came about needing to compile Mapnik, which I had intended to do on the server at some point anyways, yet I ran into memory constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good old distcc comes to the rescue. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to use distcc that often, yet when I do, it is very handy. However, I always forget to set g++ to use distcc as well. So, for when I forget next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty lazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t (ironically) like to type, and I really don&amp;rsquo;t like typing the same command over and over. I found myself switching between my external monitor and laptop quite frequently, and decided to somewhat automate the task. Although I know there are other programs out there that allow this, they either had too many features, or crashed. Xrandr works just fine, but like I said, I&amp;rsquo;m lazy&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can read, I&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling around quite a bit lately. This means I haven&amp;rsquo;t been checking the comments on my blog, which means quite a bit of spam has been entered. I am blocking the spam via akismet, however, it is still recorded in the database. Being somebody who hates cluttered desktops, you can imagine how I feel about having a lot (447) of spam. Well, since akismet flips the is_public switch True for good comments and False for bad comments, that makes a &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; easy query in mysql.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Works With Windows Vista</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Tibet right now, so will keep this somewhat brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next few hours I&amp;rsquo;ll be sitting in this dingy internet cafe in Lhasa updating my blog with my travels. I happened to look down and on the monitor it says &amp;ldquo;works with windows vista&amp;rdquo;. I find this quite humorous, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; it is going to work with vista, it is a normal generic monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I guess there is a reason for marketing. Back to writing our travels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things I regret is not utilizing Xen more. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally been admitted to Amazon&amp;rsquo;s EC2 Limited Beta, just two days before I leave, so not enough time to actually do anything fun. However, I think Xen is an ideal infrastructure aid for SMEs in particular. The cost of technology is continuing to decrease, which means bigger servers cost less. This is great for the small/branch office. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be my last post from Taiwan, and I&amp;rsquo;m placing it in my tech section. Shortly I will be flying to Hong Kong, and then traveling into China. I&amp;rsquo;m not bringing my laptop with me. I&amp;rsquo;m always a little wary of using public computers, especially in many of the poorly run internet cafes. Often the logged in user is the administrator, and we all know the computers are obviously crawling with worms and keyloggers. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenMoko In Person</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2007 20:30:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/openmoko-in-person_6379.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting up with some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openmoko.org&#34;&gt;OpenMoko&lt;/a&gt; guys. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen me write a little bit about this project, but meeting them and actually getting to play with a device was quite enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most foreigners in Taipei take taxis, but not I. My girlfriend gave me a rough estimate how to go to FIC headquarters, yet it was &amp;ndash; rough. I jumped on the right bus, going the right direction, yet didn&amp;rsquo;t really know where to get off. In my broken Chinese I started talking to a group of high school kids, who somewhat pointed me in the right direction. At one point we were coming up to a light and a lady just said: &amp;ldquo;get off, go down that road.&amp;rdquo; I grabbed my bag and jumped off the bus. The street signs started to resemble the characters I had written down, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know which direction to go in. I asked a travel agency, and they pointed me in the right direction &amp;ndash; and then it started to rain. I luckily found FIC without getting too wet, and quickly met Sean, the project leader for OpenMoko.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can easily see that I am a big Linux fan, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this over and over. I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m finishing up my MCSE, which started as a dare with my buddy, Ian. In the process of studying for my MCSE I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a certain amount of respect for Windows Server 2003, yet I&amp;rsquo;ll comment more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really wanted to write two paragraphs about was an interesting discovery I made today. I happened to stumble over to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s hardware site, and noticed in my little Server Spy monitor that it was running IIS/7 &amp;ndash; the first time I have seen this anywhere. Upon further investigation I perused their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iis.net/default.aspx?tabid=7&amp;amp;subtabid=79&#34;&gt;GoLive program&lt;/a&gt;, which details several ways to test drive IIS7. There are some details about Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s setup, which one would expect to be impressive. And it is. So, if you are a Microsoft person, you may want to grab a test drive of Beta3 while you still can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The buzz of Computex is finally wearing off, so I&amp;rsquo;ll finally scribe my account of the event. YS was kind enough to go with me, we actually called it a date. The scene was quite similar to the trade shows we saw last year, however there seemed to be fewer people. This might be because we went on the final day, although we suspect there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many people because there aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; deals to be had. Regardless, there were several main &amp;ldquo;halls&amp;rdquo; filled full of stuff. The first three (two were in one building) weren&amp;rsquo;t particularly interesting. I mean, there were some cool displays and lots of technology, but nothing that left me thinking &amp;ldquo;oh, that&amp;rsquo;s cool&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;oh, me wanna.&amp;rdquo; Until we hit the last hall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today on &lt;a href=&#34;http://community.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/06/07/1458229&#34;&gt;Linux.com, Liferea was mentioned&lt;/a&gt; I find this particularly because I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Liferea for quite a few months, and haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find anything that better suits my needs. It sits quietly in the corner until a new RSS is available, and slightly changes color. Plus, it integrates wonderfully into GNOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the Linux.com article does a great job summarizing the reader, so if you are in the market, I&amp;rsquo;d take a look. For posterities sake, I took a screenshot of the Linux.com feed of Liferea, in Liferea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I generally like Firefox, and generally like Google. But having Google suggest enabled when I search for things is annoying, at least on my rather small laptop screen. Mostly it is because my internet right now is pretty crap, so I try to cut down on any extra traffic. Anyhow, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even both Googling how to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type in &amp;lsquo;about:config&amp;rsquo; into your address bar and type &amp;lsquo;search&amp;rsquo; in the top filter bar. Look about half-way down for this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding Search to Django</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/adding-search-to-django_6300.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2007 20:30:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/adding-search-to-django_6300.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is fairly well documented in the Django docs, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be brief. This is the the bit of search code I use in almost all of my Django sites, and it works great:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
def search(request):
    from django.db.models import Q
    q = request.GET.get(&amp;#34;q&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;)
    if q and len(q) &amp;gt;= 3:
        clause = Q(dirtword\_\_icontains=q)               \\
               | Q(description\_\_icontains=q)       \\
               | Q(tags\_\_name\_\_icontains=q)        
        site\_search = Dirt.objects.filter(clause).distinct()
    else:
        site\_search = Dirt.objects.order\_by(&amp;#39;?&amp;#39;)\[:100\]
    return list\_detail.object\_list(
        request              = request,
        queryset             = site\_search,
        template\_name        = &amp;#34;dirty/search.html&amp;#34;,
        template\_object\_name = &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;,
        paginate\_by          = 20,
        extra\_context        = {&amp;#34;q&amp;#34; : q},
    )  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this should be pretty self-explanatory, the process goes like this: q is taken from the GET request and if it is over three characters long, it is searched for in the dirtword column, through the description and also through the m2m relationship of tags__name. Yup, it is pretty nifty to be able to access relationship in this way (tags__name). You will notice that at the end of each search it says &amp;ldquo;__icontains&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; this simply does a fuzzy search for the word. Once the queryset is created (the filter) I&amp;rsquo;ve added a .distinct() on the end &amp;ndash;this prevents multiple rows from being returned to the template. If there isn&amp;rsquo;t a search, or it isn&amp;rsquo;t long enough, a random list will be returned.&lt;br&gt;
One thing I like to do is include the search as extra_context &amp;ndash; this allows you to say something like &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve searched for&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; at the top of your search. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine implementing a search feature as being any easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Django Syndication with Colddirt</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/django-syndication-with-colddirt_5107.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating feeds in Django is freaking simple. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with an example of just updating a feed with the newest objects (for instace, newest blog posts). Similar to the forms.py way of handling our different forms, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a feeds.py to handle the feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedspy&#34;&gt;feeds.py&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
from django.contrib.syndication.feeds import Feed
from colddirt.dirty.models import Dirt

class LatestDirts(Feed):
    title = &amp;#34;Cold Dirt&amp;#34;
    link = &amp;#34;/&amp;#34;
    description = &amp;#34;When you have dirt, you&amp;#39;ve got dirt.  Right...&amp;#34;
    copyright = &amp;#39;All Rights Unreserved&amp;#39;
    
    def items(self):
        return Dirt.objects.all()\[:50\]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this will do is query our Dirt DB and return an obj. The fields here are pretty well documented in the Django docs, besides being pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/django-syndication-with-colddirt-ii_3665.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered a really simple syndication example, I&amp;rsquo;ll move onto something a little more complex. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to offer syndication that is slightly more custom. The Django &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/syndication_feeds/&#34;&gt;syndication docs&lt;/a&gt; give an example from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.holovaty.com/&#34;&gt;Adrian&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagocrime.org/&#34;&gt;Chicagocrime.org&lt;/a&gt; syndication of beats. I had to ponder a minute to get &amp;ldquo;custom&amp;rdquo; syndication to work, so here&amp;rsquo;s my example from start to finish.&lt;br&gt;
First, as usual, feeds.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedspy&#34;&gt;feeds.py&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PerDirt(Feed):

    link = &amp;#34;/&amp;#34;
    copyright = &amp;#39;Copyright (c) 2007, Blog Mozaic&amp;#39;
    
    def get\_object(self, bits):

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that this differs slightly from the simpler syndication example. I&amp;rsquo;ll not a few things. But first, I need to show urls.py:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hear many complaints and questions about newforms, but I&amp;rsquo;ve personally found it rather easy and logical to use. There are numerous ways for you to use do forms in Django, and most likely the best way to see them all is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/newforms/&#34;&gt;read the docs&lt;/a&gt;. On the Colddirt demo site, this is how I used newforms. I&amp;rsquo;ll take the index page as an example.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve accessed the newforms module like so:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Ajax with Django</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/simple-ajax-with-django_1754.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2007 20:30:00 +1000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/06/simple-ajax-with-django_1754.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the Django developers, in my opinion, are freaking smart. Instead of bundling Django with a particular library, they have added XML and JSON serialization; us humble users can choose whatever AJAX library we want. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prototypejs.org/&#34;&gt;Prototype 1.5.1&lt;/a&gt; has been pretty fun to work with, so I&amp;rsquo;ll kick off this demo with a really simple example.&lt;br&gt;
How simple? The intended goal is to have the total number of &amp;lsquo;dirts&amp;rsquo; update without user intervention. &lt;em&gt;Laaaammmeee&lt;/em&gt;. If you are a visual type of person, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colddirt.com/huh/&#34;&gt;take a look&lt;/a&gt; on the Colddirt &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colddirt.com/huh/&#34;&gt;huh&lt;/a&gt; page. That number automatically increases without user intervention. And this is how.&lt;br&gt;
The process (some pseudocode) will go like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been in I.T. for quite a few years, upgrading can sometimes be quite a hassle. Having switched to Linux for many years, the crazy upgrade madness of windows is gone. So, how easy is upgrading in Linux?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gfJ0rsA5-yezsSSBzH5fSQ?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgdy7UBLsk4QTB1cYb0IXBmWjq5f4F5CcjYlthEQcPG8lPwKy0aYqu5Gsy30wZhOatB_KxYU0RJPubZVjO78EgQcpBmRi0zakN7fHOek4DmgG9bRj1F-FxP4vpWLmEaJvxLYRq6Qel-W2l/s288/Screenshot-feisty.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yea, pretty darn easy, I must admit. And my system certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t normal! It has been an upgrade from Debian Sarge(ish) -&amp;gt; Ubuntu LTS(ish) -&amp;gt; 6.10 -&amp;gt; 7.04&amp;hellip; The only hiccup was at some point when the fonts were reinstalling (I totally ignored the &amp;ldquo;close all programs&amp;rdquo; warning:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you can see by my previous post, my question to squeeze more req/sec from the server, I decided to try out Gentoo (again, last time was four years ago). Now, I like Gentoo, there is no doubt about that. However, I realized things took just &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; long to get set up. I guess that is the disadvantage of a source based package management tool. Back to Debian I go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate relationship with Linux. I love it because if there is a problem, I can actually tinker and find the problem and fix it. But I hate it because I like to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a fair amount of Django programming &amp;ndash; enjoying every minute of it. After completing several of my projects I decided to do some benchmarks, and the results are in! Generally I can server cached/semi-cached pages at about 200req/sec. 200req! Considering this is 5,000,000 or so requests a day, and a number I am never going to reach, I still began to wonder: why isn&amp;rsquo;t it higher? I mean, serving a static html page is at like 1000+ req/sec, so why would a cached page be significantly different? I started exploring and noticed that Apache would spike the CPU. Ok, time to be thorough, and as I said, I like to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this just in case somebody runs into this same issue. I&amp;rsquo;m about to go live with a website and figured it would be best to have the latest SVN snapshot checked out from Django. I updated, and noticed that my voting module didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work as expected. I was getting the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;module&amp;#39; object has no attribute &amp;#39;GenericForeignKey&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumped into Trac and noticed that &lt;em&gt;just yesterday&lt;/em&gt; some things were rearranged. In short, if you are using generic relations, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change two parts of your code. First, the generic relations field must be imported out of conttenttype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like using PSAD, both on my server and my laptop. You never know where the mean people are. I also seem to use syslog-ng quite often, meanwhile PSAD seems oriented to syslog. This is fine, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure the install.pl for the source built will configure syslog-ng.conf automatically. However, I almost always tend to stick with packages if I can &amp;ndash; if they are even remotely close to the current version.&lt;br&gt;
Anyways, if you need to get syslog-ng.conf configured for PSAD, this is what you need to do:&lt;br&gt;
Add this code to the &amp;ldquo;# pipes&amp;rdquo; section, maybe stick to keeping it alphabetical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have the pleasure of owning an old T23 laptop. To show you how old this puppy is, the current T series is at &lt;em&gt;T60&lt;/em&gt;, and those have been out for over a year. This laptop was made in 2012, and I picked it up somewhat discounted late in 2003. It is now March 2007, and this puppy is still rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You heard me, it is almost six years old and still working fine &amp;ndash; that is testimony to how well this laptop was built. There are several small cracks around the case, but nothing you would notice by just walking by. This laptop has been to more countries than many people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_IP_database&#34;&gt;GeoIP&lt;/a&gt; is the concept that allows you to map a user&amp;rsquo;s IP to the country it came from (I hacked up my commenting system just so you can see an example, if you are a visual type of person). Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads &amp;ldquo;better,&amp;rdquo; hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele. Sometimes the adaptation doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work as expected. This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) &amp;ndash; and just had to snap a few screenshots. The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and &amp;ldquo;customized&amp;rdquo; the advertisement. Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It should come as a surprise that I enjoy using Linux. For the record, the first time I booted into Linux on my own was 1997, this was just before entering high school. So, while some of my tech friends played with NT, I was rumbling with the Penguin. Starting in 2000 I was using Linux as my main operating system, sometimes supplemented by OS X, and only using Windows when the gaming urge surfaced. In 2004 I mostly dropped playing any games, which resulted in dropping Windows &amp;ndash; and besides for work, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back in the day&lt;/em&gt; the barrier to entry for the Internet was quite high. The technology used required a steep learning curve, the equipment extremely expensive, and sometimes even hard to acquire. Fast forward to 2007 and things have certainly changed. If you know any tech people you can likely get free hosting for a small website, and even more demanding websites can be hosted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vpslink.com/vps-hosting/&#34;&gt;for not much&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of dedicated servers has dropped even more. And the final kicker: web services. I&amp;rsquo;ve started to think of some web services not as a service, but more like outsourcing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For one of my projects I need to generate thumbnails for a page. And lots and lots and lots of them. Even though I can generate them via a python script and a very light &amp;ldquo;gtk browser&amp;rdquo;, I would prefer to mitigate the server load. To do this I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to tap into the Alexa Thumbnail Service. They allow two methods: REST and SOAP. After several hours of testing things out, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to toss in the towel and settle on REST. If you can spot the error with my SOAP setup, I owe you a beer.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m using the ZSI module for python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, I have some projects cooked up. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to make a million bucks (wish me luck!), but a few extra bills in the pocket wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m highly considering further education, which will set me back a few-thirty grand. That said, one of my projects will rely heavily on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAWS-home-page-Money%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3435361&amp;amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1&#34;&gt;. Amazon has, for quite some time now, opened up their information via REST and SOAP. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying (virtually the entire day) to get SOAP to work, but seem to get snagged on a few issues. Stay tuned.&lt;br&gt;
However, in my quest to read every RTFM I stumbled upon a post regarding Python+REST to access &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D269962011%26no%3D239513011%26me%3DA36L942TSJ2AJA&amp;amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&#34;&gt;Alexa Web Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1&#34;&gt;. After staring at Python code, especially trying to grapple why SOAP isn&amp;rsquo;t working, updating the outdated REST code was a 5 minute hack. So, if you are interested in using Alexa Web Search with Python via Rest, look below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;m a big Linux guy I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to some features, but the program seems to be a gem. It is brainlessly easy to install (even when doing 20 things at once), and works quite well. Thanks to Ben and Sean for helping me test it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Version 3.0 Part Two</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2007/02/version-30-part-two_8083.html</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2007/02/version-30-part-two_8083.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m basically all done upgrading to Version 3.0, I deserve a cake or something. Here&amp;rsquo;s the 411:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I have been using Mambo, then Joomla, to manage the content on my site. It worked quite well, and was in PHP, so I could add or remove any code. Indeed, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a decent amount of PHP apps. In early 2004 I wrote a PHP platform to track adventures people had gone on, and networked people seeking to go on adventures with each other. I never marketed it, and mainly created it to learn PHP, but it was a CMS (Content Management System), and a little more. Late in 2004 I wrote another blog-esque platform for my second trip to Europe. It was pretty cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit: Casey and I each had a blog, and people could leave us &amp;ldquo;dares&amp;rdquo; and/or messages &amp;ndash; and we could easily update our status. Overall, it worked great. You can also see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/projects/&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; section of my site for some of the other things I&amp;rsquo;ve done in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.  Time to stop being lazy.  Time to stop procrastinating.  Time to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won&amp;rsquo;t be based off PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know by now, I&amp;rsquo;m in Taiwan.  Live is pretty good here, especially the internet &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on a pretty decent 12M/1M connection.  But the company I have my internet through seems pretty laid back about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/networks.lasso&#34;&gt;network usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-- which for me isn&amp;rsquo;t good.  Their entire IP subnet appears banned from IRC, which means I have to be a little sneaky when I want to talk to my I.T. friends in New Zealand.  Worse, some websites even banned the entire subnet:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my Snort, I really do.  But sometimes, I just don&amp;rsquo;t need all the extra overhead &amp;ndash; sometimes the resources on a server are somewhat, limited.  Looking for a solution I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/&#34;&gt;PSAD&lt;/a&gt; , a way to detect port scans.  Since port scans are often one of the first tactics used to find vulnerabilities on a server, it is a pretty good idea to detect them.   Depending on the attack, I receive a nice little email telling me what is going on.  To test it out I first fired up nmap, and received a few emails.  Next I fired up nessus with updated plugins &amp;ndash; you can be the judge.  I now have 50 emails from myself telling me somebody is doing something naughty:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically I&amp;rsquo;ve used the ever-so-popular AutoMySQLBackup script.  While it seems to work just fine, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give another solution a whirl.  This solution, provided through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zmanda.com/&#34;&gt;Zmanda&lt;/a&gt;, seems to be less hackery and more enterprise.  The instructions are very clear, and the backup test went as planned.  Looks  like this is another gem for the toolchest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ianfitzpatrick.com/&#34;&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;  mentioned Amazon&amp;rsquo;s S3 service, and the potential for using it for fun webapps.  While utilizing it for webapps will have to wait a few months, I was able to use it as a cheap backup for my home server (pictures, documents, etc,.) &amp;ndash; and my server that houses my email and websites.  The setup is pretty quick, and most of it can be detailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.eberly.org/2006/10/09/how-automate-your-backup-to-amazon-s3-using-s3sync/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The ruby package is &lt;a href=&#34;http://s3sync.net/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;   I&amp;rsquo;ll toss in my recommendation to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jets3t.dev.java.net/&#34;&gt;jets3t Cockpit&lt;/a&gt; application for viewing the buckets, especially considering the Firefox extension didn&amp;rsquo;t work as advertised.  My only two comments will be this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2006/11/mysql-compat_1690.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve run into this error quite a few times, might as well toss blog entry about it:&lt;br&gt;
ERROR 1064 at line 17: You have an error in your SQL syntax near &amp;lsquo;ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1&amp;rsquo; at line 7&lt;br&gt;
One likely reason this comes about is because the data being imported/exported is not compatible with the database version. For instance, at home you export the information from a mysql5 database. Then you try to import it on a mysql3.23 database somewhere else &amp;ndash; and it craps out on you. Bummer.&lt;br&gt;
The solution is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ianfitzpatrick.com/&#34;&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; keeps bugging me at how great Quicksilver is. Knowning that there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be an alternative built for linux, I accidently stumbled across Katapult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it still has a little room to grow, Katapult makes a great tool in any KDE toolchest. Press ALT+SPACE, and your widget fires up, ready to take your orders. Since words don&amp;rsquo;t really do this justice, I created a screencast.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the next year I plan to make a little video, nothing fancy likely, but something that will require an editor. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t own a mac (which rules our Final Cut Pro + After Effect and iMovie, which Ian and I both have had too much fun with. Inside joke.) I&amp;rsquo;m also a die-hard Linux fan, trying to hold out buying a mac for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SF to the rescure. There are four editors listed, and in the next year I&amp;rsquo;ll try them all. Overalll, they look quite promising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/2006/10/three-little-commands-and-pen-test_9.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yea, you read that right. Three commands and you can run a pen-test on your website/webserver. So, how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kelvin@home:&lt;del&gt;$ sudo apt-get install nikto&lt;br&gt;
kelvin@home:&lt;/del&gt;$ sudo nikto -update&lt;br&gt;
kelvin@home:~$ nikto -h &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtdeposit.net&#34;&gt;www.thoughtdeposit.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Nikto is a web server scanner, apparently for over 3200 dangerous files/vulnerabilities. Additional features can be seen at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cirt.net/code/nikto.shtml&#34;&gt;Nikto&lt;/a&gt; website, yet you will certainly want to add this old gem to your webserver toolbelt as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I think one of the thickest barriers to entry regarding Linux is variety. I love variety, but general end users don&amp;rsquo;t adjust well to change (IMHO). Thus enter the stage: Portland. So, what does this mean to the end user? This means that, eventually, the UI throughout linux will all look similar &amp;ndash; regardless if it is designed to utilize GTK, QT or anything else (that is, if it is built off the Portland standard).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like most standards, I can&amp;rsquo;t deny it. One thing that I find too humorous is the amount of sites that are not valid, even sites that claim they are. One tool in my box is &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/249/&#34;&gt;HTML Validator&lt;/a&gt;, an extensioin for Firefox. A nice little icon appears in the lower right, indicating whether a page is valid, not-so-valid, or really-not-so-valid. Makes it easy to check your own sites, and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Information is power, or so many of us think. As an I.T. administrator, no matter what the level, it is of my opinion that knowing what your network is doing is important. This includes regular operation, what it could do in the event of a disaster, or when it is just slightly not functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeez, I&amp;rsquo;m personifying a computer network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in another post, I setup &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/monitoring-traffic-usage/&#34;&gt;network monitoring&lt;/a&gt; for several nodes. But, what happens when an anomaly occurs? This is the story of hunting down a worm/virus, from far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logs spiraling crazy, we run out of disk space all the time. A nifty trick to find where the disk went is to issue: du -cks * |sort -rn |head -11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This returns where the disk usage is, and makes finding the bloated log a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip for Firefox. An extension called BugMeNot enables you to right click on &amp;ldquo;general&amp;rdquo; forms and say &amp;ldquo;Login with BugMeNot.&amp;rdquo; Firefox will call the BugMeNot extension which looks up in an external database login information. For instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com&#34;&gt;www.nytimes.com&lt;/a&gt; requires a login, which is a great place to test it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling we will shortly be deploying many Linux servers to perform certain actions. Maybe we will implement Asterisk to be used as a VoIP interchange between locations, maybe the backup servers will be Linux based, maybe the BDCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that could speed up implementation at remote sites is to build live cds for certain purposes. For instance, on the file server in PDX to keep updated live cds for certain projects. Like, a BDC live cd or a backup live cd. Already setup with the most current packages (or scripts to fetch+install them). So when we get to the site we just put the CD in, click or type &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; and poof, the server is installed and configured.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t want to have a billion servers each doing their own task &amp;ndash; so what can we use as a solution? Server virtualization (or semi-virtualization or para-virtualization). This involves cutting down a server into mini servers that each have full customization. Our VPS at hostmysite is like this. So why would you want to do this? A few reasons actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Localize exploits. Let&amp;rsquo;s say DNS gets exploited &amp;ndash; the access gained would only be for DNS, and not for mail and web and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hamachi is a VPN alternative that does not have the normal router problems associated with IPSEC and PPTP vpns. That is good because of firewalls and nat and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
