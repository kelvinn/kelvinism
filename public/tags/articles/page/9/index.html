<p>I have the pleasure of owning an old T23 laptop. To show you how old this puppy is, the current T series is at <em>T60</em>, and those have been out for over a year. This laptop was made in 2012, and I picked it up somewhat discounted late in 2003. It is now March 2007, and this puppy is still rock solid.</p>
<p>You heard me, it is almost six years old and still working fine &ndash; that is testimony to how well this laptop was built. There are several small cracks around the case, but nothing you would notice by just walking by. This laptop has been to more countries than many people.</p>
<p>I had the first problem this weekend, and it isn&rsquo;t even related to the laptop. The hard drive, a 30G I put in at some point, started to crap out on me. Bad sectors were everywhere, so some of the programs were slightly unhappy (e.g. I couldn&rsquo;t boot into X).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy a new laptop soon, I promise, about the time my <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/mba-funding/">MBA goals</a> are reached. Until then, I&rsquo;ll continue to be frugal, and deal with the bad sectors. Being a good IT nerd, everything is backed up to an external hard drive (and most stuff backed up remotely).</p>
<p>Luckily I&rsquo;m using Linux &ndash; so was able to runs fsck/smartmontools a few times in recovery mode, make the bad blocks happy, and continue as &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Phew, disaster averted.</p>

<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m in a coffee shop? GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_IP_database">GeoIP</a> is the concept that allows you to map a user&rsquo;s IP to the country it came from (I hacked up my commenting system just so you can see an example, if you are a visual type of person). Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads &ldquo;better,&rdquo; hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele. Sometimes the adaptation doesn&rsquo;t quite work as expected. This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) &ndash; and just had to snap a few screenshots. The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and &ldquo;customized&rdquo; the advertisement. Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.</p>
<p>This reminded me just how much crap people know about me; since I&rsquo;m in a coffeeshop, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> care, but still. So, why do I hate GeoIP advertising?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It reminds me how much crap people know about me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reminds me that I should be using the Tor network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of displaying contextual ads that I even <em>might be a little</em> inclined to click, it reminds me how much I hate advertising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m in a coffee shop? GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being curious, I decided to see if I could teleport the girls to other parts of the world. Enter <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>, <a href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> and <a href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">FoxyProxy</a>. I turned them all on, went back and remembered just how cool these tools really are.</p>

    <p>It should come as a surprise that I enjoy using Linux. For the record, the first time I booted into Linux on my own was 1997, this was just before entering high school. So, while some of my tech friends played with NT, I was rumbling with the Penguin. Starting in 2000 I was using Linux as my main operating system, sometimes supplemented by OS X, and only using Windows when the gaming urge surfaced. In 2004 I mostly dropped playing any games, which resulted in dropping Windows &ndash; and besides for work, I haven&rsquo;t used it since.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;ll admit, there are three things that Linux still lacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplistic video conferencing support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video editing support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaming</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that all of these are <em>supported</em>, but, in my opinion, not particularly well. Well, I don&rsquo;t care about any of these enough to actually need windows, but it would be nice to see them improve.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m set. I&rsquo;m 100% legal (don&rsquo;t steal a single piece of software). And don&rsquo;t have to be too afraid of virus&rsquo;. What prompted me to write this little excerpt? A recent article at the Washington Post scared the beejeepers out of me, and makes me wish even more for Vista to either cure security problems, or everybody move over to Linux. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/13/AR2007031301522.html">article</a> details the aftermath a virus can cause, not on damaging one&rsquo;s computer, but on capturing information. The author further <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/03/tracking_the_password_thieves_1.html">details</a> his experience hunting down the data. This was one of the better articles I&rsquo;ve read, and I thoroughly enjoyed the further details. If you want a little more motivation to move to Linux (or just tighten your machine), then I suggest you take a few moments to read the articles as well.</p>

    <p><em>Back in the day</em> the barrier to entry for the Internet was quite high. The technology used required a steep learning curve, the equipment extremely expensive, and sometimes even hard to acquire. Fast forward to 2007 and things have certainly changed. If you know any tech people you can likely get free hosting for a small website, and even more demanding websites can be hosted <a href="http://www.vpslink.com/vps-hosting/">for not much</a>. The cost of dedicated servers has dropped even more. And the final kicker: web services. I&rsquo;ve started to think of some web services not as a service, but more like outsourcing requirements.</p>
<p>This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>One of the nice things when requirements are outsourced is the fact that risk is mitigated. I&rsquo;ll use <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> as an <a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/onethumb/2006/08/12/amazon-s3-the-holy-grail/">example</a>. In summary, they moved their storage to Amason&rsquo;s S3 network, which is something I will be utilizing as well. Amazon&rsquo;s S3 (and other web services) continue to drive down the barrier of entry &ndash; now you don&rsquo;t even need to purchase hugely expensive servers for the sole purchase of storage! If you don&rsquo;t need to purchase them, you also don&rsquo;t need to manage them. Risk mitigated.</p>
<p>However, continuing the slight allusion from The Other Blog&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://www.theotherblog.com/Articles/2007/03/14/what-are-mashups-for-anyway/">mashups</a>, I see a slight problem with the outsourcing of requirements. While the following thought isn&rsquo;t particularly innovative: mitigating risk and outsourcing requirements creates a dependency on the third-party. This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>But, as is evident by the fact that I&rsquo;ve had stitches nine different times, I&rsquo;m still going to do some <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/mba-funding/">cool mashups</a> anyways, so stay tuned.</p>

    <p>For one of my projects I need to generate thumbnails for a page. And lots and lots and lots of them. Even though I can generate them via a python script and a very light &ldquo;gtk browser&rdquo;, I would prefer to mitigate the server load. To do this I&rsquo;ve decided to tap into the Alexa Thumbnail Service. They allow two methods: REST and SOAP. After several hours of testing things out, I&rsquo;ve decided to toss in the towel and settle on REST. If you can spot the error with my SOAP setup, I owe you a beer.<br>

    <p>As some of you may know, I have some projects cooked up. I don&rsquo;t expect to make a million bucks (wish me luck!), but a few extra bills in the pocket wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. Plus, I&rsquo;m highly considering further education, which will set me back a few-thirty grand. That said, one of my projects will rely heavily on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAWS-home-page-Money%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3435361&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon Web Services</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=ur2&o=1">. Amazon has, for quite some time now, opened up their information via REST and SOAP. I&rsquo;ve been trying (virtually the entire day) to get SOAP to work, but seem to get snagged on a few issues. Stay tuned.<br>
However, in my quest to read every RTFM I stumbled upon a post regarding Python+REST to access <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D269962011%26no%3D239513011%26me%3DA36L942TSJ2AJA&amp;tag=kelvinismcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Alexa Web Search</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kelvinismcom-20&l=ur2&o=1">. After staring at Python code, especially trying to grapple why SOAP isn&rsquo;t working, updating the outdated REST code was a 5 minute hack. So, if you are interested in using Alexa Web Search with Python via Rest, look below:</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around more with <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc/">Hamachi</a>, and have decided that it officially rules. Since I&rsquo;m a big Linux guy I don&rsquo;t have access to some features, but the program seems to be a gem. It is brainlessly easy to install (even when doing 20 things at once), and works quite well. Thanks to Ben and Sean for helping me test it out.</p>

    <p>Well, I&rsquo;m basically all done upgrading to Version 3.0, I deserve a cake or something. Here&rsquo;s the 411:</p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using Mambo, then Joomla, to manage the content on my site. It worked quite well, and was in PHP, so I could add or remove any code. Indeed, I&rsquo;ve written a decent amount of PHP apps. In early 2004 I wrote a PHP platform to track adventures people had gone on, and networked people seeking to go on adventures with each other. I never marketed it, and mainly created it to learn PHP, but it was a CMS (Content Management System), and a little more. Late in 2004 I wrote another blog-esque platform for my second trip to Europe. It was pretty cool, I&rsquo;ll admit: Casey and I each had a blog, and people could leave us &ldquo;dares&rdquo; and/or messages &ndash; and we could easily update our status. Overall, it worked great. You can also see the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section of my site for some of the other things I&rsquo;ve done in PHP.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and here it is in early 2007. I&rsquo;ve never really liked PHP all that much, but I couldn&rsquo;t put my thumb on it. Deciding to switch to something else, I picked up and read the book, Beginning Python, from Novice to Professional. If anybody is looking for a well written book, I would highly recommend this one. Anyways, with my goal to drop PHP in mind, I held the debate of Django and TurboGears. I went through the demos for each, and felt like I really played around with them. Ultimately it came down to 1) Django has obvious crazy cool caching, 2) Django has pretty darn good documentation, and a freaking <a href="http://www.djangobook.com">online book</a>, and 3) the &ldquo;powered by&rdquo; sites are quite impressive &ndash; both the length of the list and the large amount of traffic some of these sites entertain.</p>
<p>So I went with Django. My friend in New Zealand, Ben Ford, has been ragging me for two months to get my ass in gear and learn it, saying I would love it. And he is right, the framework is simply beautiful. For the last week I&rsquo;ve been reading through the documentation, going through the online book (both are incomplete, in my opinion, but compliment each other nicely). I think it is important to write your own code instead of just repeating examples, so my goal: transform my blog/site by using just Django.</p>
<p>So, while some of the kinks still need to be worked out, everything is no transfered over. I&rsquo;ll mention my experiences shortly, but overall: I&rsquo;m very impressed.</p>

    <p>To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.  I&rsquo;ve been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.  Time to stop being lazy.  Time to stop procrastinating.  Time to learn something new.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won&rsquo;t be based off PHP.</p>
