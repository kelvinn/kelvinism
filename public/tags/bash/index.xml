      <title>Reduce Bandwidth By Shrinking Images</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s brother has a simple WordPress-based website that I set up for him a few year ago - and he likes to post a lot of images. For various reasons I have it hosted on my VPS in Australia, which only comes with 15GB of bandwidth, most likely because I got a crazy good deal on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, that isn&amp;rsquo;t much bandwidth. Each page of his site was previously using almost 10MB of bandwidth per view - which meant the 15GB was running out. I deduced the high usage in Firebug and noticed it was *gasp* from large images, some almost 1MB large. The images on the server are contained in subdirectories under a gallery folder - and I wanted to resize them. What I actually wanted to do was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Renaming Apache Log Locations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them. I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file. logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log &amp;ndash; e.g. kelvinism_access_log. I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind. I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS. If I had a million dollars, I&amp;rsquo;d likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to. Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent. I mean, the type of software where you aren&amp;rsquo;t asking &amp;ldquo;I wish this could do this&amp;rdquo; and start asking &amp;ldquo;I wonder what else this can do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
