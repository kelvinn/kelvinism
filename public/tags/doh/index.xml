      <title>Downloading VMWare with Firefox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this issue happen to me several times, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally writing myself a note to fix it in the future. There seems to be an issue with downloading VMWare Workstation (.bundle). I first tried it with Firefox, but it just crapped out at loading it into /tmp. Next, I tried it with Lynx, but alas, it tried to download it as a text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahah! The quickest solution I could find is to right click the link, save as, and save it as a zip. Rename it to .bundle when you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Capped Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in several different parts of the world, and they all do internet differently. Back in the US I had 8Mb/sec cable (leaving just before Fios was really an option, darn!) In New Zealand, for instance, I was paying for &amp;ldquo;high speed ADSL&amp;rdquo; rated at 1.5Mb/256k. Vrooom. Up in Taiwan I was paying 1/2 what I paid in New Zealand, but for 12Mb/1Mb. Down to Sydney and we have a rated 24Mb/1Mb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Redirecting Fun with Lightty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of my colleagues were having just a little bit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/blog/Australia/i-caught-fish/#c1926&#34;&gt;too much fun&lt;/a&gt; with my blog, so I decided to have some fun back. Over a period of 10 minutes, they managed to leave 10+ comments. Luckily I have full control over my server, and was able to quickly create my practical joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$HTTP\[&amp;#34;remoteip&amp;#34;\] == &amp;#34;123.45.678.910&amp;#34; {
url.redirect = (
&amp;#34;^/(.\*)&amp;#34; =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck&amp;#34;,
&amp;#34;&amp;#34; =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck&amp;#34;,
&amp;#34;/&amp;#34; =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=annoying+fuck&amp;#34;
)
}

      <title>Django SVN Update Goes Splat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this just in case somebody runs into this same issue. I&amp;rsquo;m about to go live with a website and figured it would be best to have the latest SVN snapshot checked out from Django. I updated, and noticed that my voting module didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work as expected. I was getting the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;module&amp;#39; object has no attribute &amp;#39;GenericForeignKey&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumped into Trac and noticed that &lt;em&gt;just yesterday&lt;/em&gt; some things were rearranged. In short, if you are using generic relations, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change two parts of your code. First, the generic relations field must be imported out of conttenttype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Hate GeoIP Advertising</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/WRMH3mQauVVNRBo9Jr-mdQ?feat=embedwebsite&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUCe5P3KESIXOcTikN8dyhNqIGGwP9liL62sQXgx7FeGNf2oQjwyHSbe8UJxuveH6RlUmFs8_120nmV_9XNj3aShEdCP_nH9j8lPYXkgEGTyzaztQOH0PxR8ClpM4MYqJP2I4hmV3RGfwS/s400/geoiphell1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, I&amp;rsquo;m in a coffee shop? GeoIPized Girls = have to sit with back to wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_IP_database&#34;&gt;GeoIP&lt;/a&gt; is the concept that allows you to map a user&amp;rsquo;s IP to the country it came from (I hacked up my commenting system just so you can see an example, if you are a visual type of person). Advertisers have long since picked up on this as a way to make their ads &amp;ldquo;better,&amp;rdquo; hopefully becoming more appealing to their clientele. Sometimes the adaptation doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work as expected. This morning I was searching for an eBook on Embedded Linux (it is really hard to find English tech books here) &amp;ndash; and just had to snap a few screenshots. The advertisers picked up my IP, from Taiwan, and &amp;ldquo;customized&amp;rdquo; the advertisement. Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a total of five white females here over the entire last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Darn You HiNet</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2007/01/darn-you-hinet_4291.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may know by now, I&amp;rsquo;m in Taiwan.  Live is pretty good here, especially the internet &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on a pretty decent 12M/1M connection.  But the company I have my internet through seems pretty laid back about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/networks.lasso&#34;&gt;network usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-- which for me isn&amp;rsquo;t good.  Their entire IP subnet appears banned from IRC, which means I have to be a little sneaky when I want to talk to my I.T. friends in New Zealand.  Worse, some websites even banned the entire subnet:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
