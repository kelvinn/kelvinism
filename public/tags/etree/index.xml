      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying French with my partner, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve read any of this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a techie. Often several of my interests collide, which is what happened today. I was searching for the &amp;ldquo;most frequent french words,&amp;rdquo; and while I found some lists, nothing was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br&gt;
My desire was to have a PDF of the top few thousand most used French words. With the English translation next to it. In order. I&amp;rsquo;ve found some great resources, which I&amp;rsquo;ll list now&lt;/p&gt;</description>
