      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last year YS and I have been studying French once a week (4.5hr on Saturday!) A few months ago I wrote some Python code to read the RSS feeds of the most popular French newspaper site, and then kept track of the count of each word. I repeated this every week for a few months.&lt;br&gt;
In the end I had a database of the top ~3000 words used on the site. Today I decided I wanted to play with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/www.processing.org&#34;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;, so created this little word collage. It is 1680x1050, my monitor&amp;rsquo;s resolution. Two thumbs up for Processing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying French with my partner, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve read any of this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a techie. Often several of my interests collide, which is what happened today. I was searching for the &amp;ldquo;most frequent french words,&amp;rdquo; and while I found some lists, nothing was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br&gt;
My desire was to have a PDF of the top few thousand most used French words. With the English translation next to it. In order. I&amp;rsquo;ve found some great resources, which I&amp;rsquo;ll list now&lt;/p&gt;</description>
