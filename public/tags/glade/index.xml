      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I do sysadminy stuff all day, I don&amp;rsquo;t really get a chance to do much coding (or not as much of a chance as I would like). You can imagine my joy when my girlfriend expressed a problem she needed solved: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to solve 100s of slope equations, i.e. where two lines intersect. Can you write a program to do it?&amp;rdquo; Sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if she wanted to do a batch input or just a one-off type of deal, she decided on the latter. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve done a fair bit of PyGTK stuff, I had never actually needed to convert it to Windows. I debated using IronPython &amp;ndash; but needed to use a special library to help solve the equations (I&amp;rsquo;m lazy).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed another Python fix, and I need one pretty badly. I spent the weekend wondering why it appears to be impossible to edit the GUIDs inside an Exchange mailbox store (read: NOT the GUIDs stored in AD for Exchange). Anyways, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals were simple. I wanted to use Python, wanted something to do with traffic, and wanted to play around with Glade/PyGTK and graphing stuff. My end result was a little app that allows you to specify a GPX file, and it plots the waypoints (and calculates the moving average!). Pretty simple, pretty useless, but pretty fun. I really do like pretty pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
