      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased an Echo from Amazon, and we were contemplating how else to better integrate it with our somewhat minimalistic home. I thought it would be interesting to get it to link to a WiFi-enabled power outlet, but unfortunately they are pretty expensive in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I stumbled across the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/&#34;&gt;Sonoff&lt;/a&gt;Â devices by Itead, and learned that they were somewhat hackable via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota&#34;&gt;custom firmware&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally I received the two devices on the same day my daughter was off sick, so when she had her nap, I got hacking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
