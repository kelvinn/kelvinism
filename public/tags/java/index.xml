      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for a new project. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided I want to do some electronics stuff - at least play around in that realm a little. However, I want to &amp;ldquo;get out and about&amp;rdquo; a little as well, so this leads me to my idea: a controllable long-range RC plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been debating whether to go the embedded Linux route, or the more simple microcontroller route. One of the first things I stumbled upon was &lt;a href=&#34;http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A44814&#34;&gt;ArduPilot&lt;/a&gt;, a cheap Arduino-based board allowing for a UAV. However, after looking through the requirements I would have needed to purchase an RF transmitter, and they aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap. This made me rethink the ArduPilot route and to evaluate what I really wanted to do: control the plan. My ultimate goal is to attach a joystick to my computer and be able to control the RC plane. This presents another problem with the ArduPilot, however, as there isn&amp;rsquo;t an extra Rx pin available on the ArduPilot board (or so the forums say), I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to transmit coordinates on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
