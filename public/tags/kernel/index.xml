      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Atheros for quite some time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the madwifi drivers. They allowed really easy switching into monitor mode, and decent levels of packet injection. However, since I&amp;rsquo;m mostly in an office now, instead of writing web apps in cafes and trying to score free internet, I don&amp;rsquo;t really need anything fancy. My gentoo stage 1 (3?) days are over. I use Ubuntu, because I&amp;rsquo;m lazy, and it mostly works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After writing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://kelvinism.com/tech-blog/compiling-kernel-vortex86dx/&#34;&gt;compiling a new kernel&lt;/a&gt; for the Vortex86DX, I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a few people email me asking how I installed Debian in the first place. The installation is actually quite straightforward, but it involved several quirky techniques. After doing another install I decided to keep track of the process of installing Debian 5.0 on my eBox-3300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following guide assumes a few things. First, you are currently using Linux and a debian variety (although instructions could be altered if using Windows). Second, your USB shows up as /dev/sdb. Third, your eBox-3300 has the HDD set in Native mode. Forth, you are patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve written up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://kelvinism.com/howtos/installing-debian-50-vortex86dx/&#34;&gt;short tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on the method I used to install Debian 5.0 on this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I purchased the eBox-3300 from WDL Systems. The system was promptly shipped, and there were no &amp;ldquo;gotchas&amp;rdquo; from WDL. The little box fit my exact needs - it is small, and built very, very well. I flew back to Australia and, after some trial and error, installed Debian 5.0 on it. For quite some time I was just using the vmlinuz file provided by WDL, which was provided by ICOP (DMP). This worked well, but there were two issues:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
