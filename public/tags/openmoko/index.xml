      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting up with some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openmoko.org&#34;&gt;OpenMoko&lt;/a&gt; guys. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen me write a little bit about this project, but meeting them and actually getting to play with a device was quite enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most foreigners in Taipei take taxis, but not I. My girlfriend gave me a rough estimate how to go to FIC headquarters, yet it was &amp;ndash; rough. I jumped on the right bus, going the right direction, yet didn&amp;rsquo;t really know where to get off. In my broken Chinese I started talking to a group of high school kids, who somewhat pointed me in the right direction. At one point we were coming up to a light and a lady just said: &amp;ldquo;get off, go down that road.&amp;rdquo; I grabbed my bag and jumped off the bus. The street signs started to resemble the characters I had written down, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know which direction to go in. I asked a travel agency, and they pointed me in the right direction &amp;ndash; and then it started to rain. I luckily found FIC without getting too wet, and quickly met Sean, the project leader for OpenMoko.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
