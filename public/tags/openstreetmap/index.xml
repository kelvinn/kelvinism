      <title>Sydney Commute Times Mapped Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2013/07/sydney-commute-times-mapped-part-1.html&#34;&gt;Sydney Commute Times Mapped Part 1&lt;/a&gt; I took a small step to a bigger goal of mashing together public transport in Sydney, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://strategies.planning.nsw.gov.au/Portals/0/Documents/MetroCommunityGuide.pdf&#34;&gt;Metropolitan Strategy for Sydney to 2031&lt;/a&gt;. The question I wanted to answer is this: how aligned is Sydney&amp;rsquo;s public transport infrastructure and the Metropolitan Strategy&amp;rsquo;s of a &amp;ldquo;city of cities&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the release of GTFS data by 131500 it is possible to visualise how long it takes via public transport to commute to the nearest &amp;ldquo;centre&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another Baby Step</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I showed a few of my co-workers my graph and one replied &amp;ndash; oh! that&amp;rsquo;s really cool. (I think only two of my co-workers are actually interested in my geekyness). He then emailed me tonight a .kmz file containing a colorized file of his speed. I looked at the kml and noticed it appeared to be dynamically allocated judging by the top speed. Well, as you could guess, I surely had to modify my code to include colors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Baby Steps at Graphing Traffic</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2008/04/baby-steps-at-graphing-traffic_522.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Status:&lt;br&gt;
You can likely tell that I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some fun with graphing and mapping recently. I was reading a few articles about GIS and stumbled upon a pretty darn cool project at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webopticon.com/projects/neighborhood_nets&#34;&gt;Webopticon&lt;/a&gt;, which included cool pictures. I showed it to my girlfriend thinking she would find it interesting, and then realized: oh! KML has an altitude attribute. That could be interesting.&lt;br&gt;
One of my projects is to create &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kelvinism.com/2007/12/sydneys-driving-habits.html&#34;&gt;maps of Sydney&amp;rsquo;s traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I have been experimenting heavily with Mapnik and OSM. I figured I could have some fun and finally parse some gps tracks and display the data.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Size of Uncompressed OSM File</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.com&#34;&gt;OSM&lt;/a&gt; a little lately, and have been meaning to construct my own slippy map. At first I wanted to do it on my VPS &amp;ndash; but with rather limited storage, and even more limited memory, there just isn&amp;rsquo;t a way. Three problems exists: the first occurs when trying to use osm2pgsql to import the OSM file into the database. Current records state that this typically uses 650+ MB, something my 512MB VPS just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have (although I&amp;rsquo;m writing some code that might make this possible in the future).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
