      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of books on parenting. Before my daughter was born I read a book on pregnancy, one of those 500 pages texts from a high class place - Mayo Clinic or Harvard or something like that. It was helpful, but given I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember the name, clearly not something that I considered life changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Million-Words-Building-Childs-ebook/dp/B00SI02BHE&#34;&gt;Thirty Million Words: Building a Child&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/a&gt; I was all hyped up to drown my new kid in words. We travelled a lot when she was young, so didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of books, but she sure had them read to her. When I took a year off as a stay-at-home-dad I kept having those 30 million words ticking in my mind. By the time she was 2 1/2 she was getting five books read to her a night. By the time she was around 3 1/2 she was listening to Amazon Story Time for an hour every evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
