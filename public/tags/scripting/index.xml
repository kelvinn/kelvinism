      <title>Renaming Apache Log Locations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I realized a few of my log files were growing unusually large, and even worse, logrotate was skipping them. I took a look in logrotate.d and straight away realized why: I had created silly names for the log file. logrotate look for .log files, but I had specified mine as .log &amp;ndash; e.g. kelvinism_access_log. I was as familiar with logrotate when I set up the domains, so set forth to get them in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not impressed too often with much software, especially the closed source kind. I find a leaning preference to all things FOSS. If I had a million dollars, I&amp;rsquo;d likely spend all day contributing to all the projects I wish I had time to contribute to. Regardless, there are a select few closed-source products that I believe are truly excellent. I mean, the type of software where you aren&amp;rsquo;t asking &amp;ldquo;I wish this could do this&amp;rdquo; and start asking &amp;ldquo;I wonder what else this can do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
