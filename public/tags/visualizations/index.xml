      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had several conversations with neighbors and co-workers about the &amp;ldquo;lack&amp;rdquo; of forward thinking, or at least the lack of forward action. Of course, I keep in the back of my mind that we aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo;, and the more I learn about transport the more I learn how complex it is. Dr. Sussman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;CLIOS&lt;/em&gt; process (Complex, Large-&lt;br&gt;
Scale, Integrated, Open Systems) appears more and more true the longer I work in and study transport. There is a plethora of excuses that can be made, but the general conclusion was that the earlier we prepare the better. I can remember working near Zhongshan 7-8 years ago and driving around on huge roads in the middle of empty fields. There weren&amp;rsquo;t even stoplights at every intersection. It was then that I had an epiphany of how smart the planning was to build the infrastructure &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the masses arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
