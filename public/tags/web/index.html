    <p>I recently had the need to add some HTML to the label for a form field using Django. The solution is pretty easy, except I didn&rsquo;t see it written explicitly anywhere, and I missed the memo of the function I should be using.<br>
My form first just had the HTML in the form label as so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
from django import forms

class AccountForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(), max\_length=15, label=&#39;Your Name ([why](http://www.blogger.com/questions/whyname/)?&#39;)
</code></pre><p>However, when I displayed it, the form was autoescaped.<br>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PyGNXDrpXtrgBNnoOLlfLA?feat=embedwebsite"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvsLvb6I4SDBB3NKptLZzGLGnwUZK0KmYlx7X9UC2_fzyQCNTkeFiKz5-4_3BmKArYZhRwU8TNEIhrGAMsb039N47hxcY8BIMEJjfK1UafYCRvAPzY18c8ceq3QFOOsp_oGO6SavZ1LmGR/s800/accountsform.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This is generally a good thing, except my form obviously didn&rsquo;t display correctly. I tried autoescaping it in the template, but that didn&rsquo;t work. To resolve this you&rsquo;ll need to mark that <em>individual label</em> as safe. Thus:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
from django.utils.safestring import mark\_safe
from django import forms

class AccountForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(), max\_length=15, label=mark\_safe(&#39;Your Name ([why](http://www.blogger.com/questions/whyname/)?)&#39;))
    
</code></pre><p>It will now display correctly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>In \[1\]: from myproject.forms import \*

In \[2\]: form = AccountForm()

In \[3\]: form.as\_ul()
Out\[3\]: u&#39;
*   Your Name ([why](http://www.blogger.com/questions/whyname/)?): 
&#39;
</code></pre><p>There&rsquo;s maybe another easier way to do this, but this worked for me.</p>

    <p><em>Back in the day</em> the barrier to entry for the Internet was quite high. The technology used required a steep learning curve, the equipment extremely expensive, and sometimes even hard to acquire. Fast forward to 2007 and things have certainly changed. If you know any tech people you can likely get free hosting for a small website, and even more demanding websites can be hosted <a href="http://www.vpslink.com/vps-hosting/">for not much</a>. The cost of dedicated servers has dropped even more. And the final kicker: web services. I&rsquo;ve started to think of some web services not as a service, but more like outsourcing requirements.</p>
<p>This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>One of the nice things when requirements are outsourced is the fact that risk is mitigated. I&rsquo;ll use <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">SmugMug</a> as an <a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/onethumb/2006/08/12/amazon-s3-the-holy-grail/">example</a>. In summary, they moved their storage to Amason&rsquo;s S3 network, which is something I will be utilizing as well. Amazon&rsquo;s S3 (and other web services) continue to drive down the barrier of entry &ndash; now you don&rsquo;t even need to purchase hugely expensive servers for the sole purchase of storage! If you don&rsquo;t need to purchase them, you also don&rsquo;t need to manage them. Risk mitigated.</p>
<p>However, continuing the slight allusion from The Other Blog&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://www.theotherblog.com/Articles/2007/03/14/what-are-mashups-for-anyway/">mashups</a>, I see a slight problem with the outsourcing of requirements. While the following thought isn&rsquo;t particularly innovative: mitigating risk and outsourcing requirements creates a dependency on the third-party. This very dependency adds risk for a multitude of reasons, and when your entire web application platform revolves around a third party, such as is the case with mashups, you incur great risk.</p>
<p>But, as is evident by the fact that I&rsquo;ve had stitches nine different times, I&rsquo;m still going to do some <a href="http://www.kelvinism.com/projects/mba-funding/">cool mashups</a> anyways, so stay tuned.</p>

    <p>Well, I&rsquo;m basically all done upgrading to Version 3.0, I deserve a cake or something. Here&rsquo;s the 411:</p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using Mambo, then Joomla, to manage the content on my site. It worked quite well, and was in PHP, so I could add or remove any code. Indeed, I&rsquo;ve written a decent amount of PHP apps. In early 2004 I wrote a PHP platform to track adventures people had gone on, and networked people seeking to go on adventures with each other. I never marketed it, and mainly created it to learn PHP, but it was a CMS (Content Management System), and a little more. Late in 2004 I wrote another blog-esque platform for my second trip to Europe. It was pretty cool, I&rsquo;ll admit: Casey and I each had a blog, and people could leave us &ldquo;dares&rdquo; and/or messages &ndash; and we could easily update our status. Overall, it worked great. You can also see the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> section of my site for some of the other things I&rsquo;ve done in PHP.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and here it is in early 2007. I&rsquo;ve never really liked PHP all that much, but I couldn&rsquo;t put my thumb on it. Deciding to switch to something else, I picked up and read the book, Beginning Python, from Novice to Professional. If anybody is looking for a well written book, I would highly recommend this one. Anyways, with my goal to drop PHP in mind, I held the debate of Django and TurboGears. I went through the demos for each, and felt like I really played around with them. Ultimately it came down to 1) Django has obvious crazy cool caching, 2) Django has pretty darn good documentation, and a freaking <a href="http://www.djangobook.com">online book</a>, and 3) the &ldquo;powered by&rdquo; sites are quite impressive &ndash; both the length of the list and the large amount of traffic some of these sites entertain.</p>
<p>So I went with Django. My friend in New Zealand, Ben Ford, has been ragging me for two months to get my ass in gear and learn it, saying I would love it. And he is right, the framework is simply beautiful. For the last week I&rsquo;ve been reading through the documentation, going through the online book (both are incomplete, in my opinion, but compliment each other nicely). I think it is important to write your own code instead of just repeating examples, so my goal: transform my blog/site by using just Django.</p>
<p>So, while some of the kinks still need to be worked out, everything is no transfered over. I&rsquo;ll mention my experiences shortly, but overall: I&rsquo;m very impressed.</p>

    <p>To all my loyal (but most likely few, and mainly with the same last name as me):</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to redo the structure of my site, yes, it is about time.  I&rsquo;ve been using a CMS (Content Management System) to categorize everything, but it is time to ditch that and write something.  Time to stop being lazy.  Time to stop procrastinating.  Time to learn something new.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear: version 3.0 surely won&rsquo;t be based off PHP.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s a tip for Firefox. An extension called BugMeNot enables you to right click on &ldquo;general&rdquo; forms and say &ldquo;Login with BugMeNot.&rdquo; Firefox will call the BugMeNot extension which looks up in an external database login information. For instance, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">www.nytimes.com</a> requires a login, which is a great place to test it out.</p>
